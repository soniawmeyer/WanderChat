37,First solo trip but I am not sure if it is for me?,"I'm really thinking of going to Berlin for a few nights alone, I feel I need the trip, and it would be good for me to do this and possibly meet some people.

However I am very introverted and not sure I will enjoy it...I've found a decent 1 bedroom private hotel as I don't think shared hostel dorms is for me, and I've made a list of things I'd like to do for daytime (museums, walking tours etc) and my evening choice is going to the blues bars to sit and watch live music, so I don't feel to awkward sat alone and I'm a big blues lover.

Not really sure what to expect from this post, just thought I'd see what people think, I'm really struggling to make my mind up! Also, does this sound like I've planned it okay and do you have any suggestions?","Go for it, you might suprise yourself as when in new spaces, every morning is Christmas morning! The Nat history museum there is splended, has some great biology displays. Have a great time!, Berlin was my second solo trip. Likewise, went for a few days and spent a lot of time exploring the museums and just walking around soaking up the atmosphere. Its a fascinating city, with a very unique vibe. Doing something for the first time always comes with a degree of anxiety, but you might be surprised with how quickly that anxiety gives way to excitement once your trip gets underway. Just take everything in your own time, and Im sure youll enjoy it. Hope you have a great visit!, Im just back from my first solo trip. Im very introverted too and I loved it. It was so nice to be by myself for a few days. I was nervous too but Im so glad I went. Go for it! , Do it! What is the worst that could happen? You go, hate it for the few days, then go home and know solo travel isnt for you. Or, you could go and have a blast! Have fun!, Berlin is fun for the solo traveller I think having a few things locked in is good but just catching the S and U Bahn walking around, just being those are great experiences too, I just spent days in london by myself and it was wonderful. I didnt plan a ton of it. I mostly walked around, saw the sights, ate food, took way too many photos. Went to a concert and bars. Riding the tube was a lot of fun too. Went to Paris for one of the days. I say all of this to encourage you to go and enjoy yourself. Make the best of it., Yeah Berelin is awesome, GO! , When you go out, you will find that it is as normal as your usual commute to get off work., I M went to Berlin for nights back in January. It was my first solo trip abroad and stayed in a hostel for the first time. Honestly I am so glad I done it. I spent my days walking riding on the eScooters, checking out local attractions, museums food. I made friends with Argentinian lads in my room and had a couple beers with them in the hostel bar. Yes there was a couple of miserableinconsiderate people in the same room, like turning the light on at am and stomping around but I could have avoided that with ear plugs and an eye mask. What Im trying to say is, if you really dont want to stay in a hostel, then fair enough but I think it is so worth doing for the experience. Fast forward to now, Ill be handing in my notice at work tomorrow with a one way ticket to Australia on a Working Holiday Visa in January! xB PS. Im a big introvert and love my own space but being put out of your comfort zone really helps with personal development , Berlin was my second solo trip and I loved it! I would recommend the Berliner Unterwelten tours taking a day to go out to Potsdam to see Schloss Sanssouci and its gardens plus of course the Berlin WallCheckpoint Charlieclassic tourist destinations. Its a really good city to just wander around in there is so much to see. If youre interested in somewhat of a social experience you could book a private room in a hostel, and then maybe meet people in the hostel bar but still have your own space. I surprised myself with how much I socialized with strangers there despite being an introvert there was a night when or of us met in the hostel bar and then decided to just go grab some drinks from a convenience store and sit in a park and talk for hours., Im super introverted and also love solo travel. One thing that took me a long time to learn was to sometimes just grab takeout or get food delivery and eat on my own for dinner. I dont know about you but dining alone at a restaurant can get draining. By taking back that time and money and eliminating the anxiety around it, it opened me up to go grab a drink always sit at the bar or do a night activity after, like a pub crawl or ghostfood tour. I always force myself to at least get outside for a walk or to go somewhere after eating. OR if Im really not feeling it, I watch Netflix or read. Its YOUR time to do what you want, not what you think other people will judge you on. Introverts only have a certain amount of social battery so use it wisely., The history walking tours are goated. Berlin has unmatched history. Make sure to go on the likes of the Berlin Wall tour or the Third Reich tour. Good way to meet fellow travellers too., However I am very introverted and not sure I will enjoy it... You should enjoy your own company then., Well... If you start with a short solotrip days you have nothing to lose. Go for it! Worst case you will hate it and not do it again. But maybe you will like it, a lot!! Go with an open mind and yeah socializing is a big part for me when solo traveling., Berlin is an excellent city for solo travel, youll love it!, My tip for something to do in the evening is a pub quiz or a gaming bar pinballarcade, I lived in Berlin years ago and loved doing things solo the museum scene is impressive Resistance Museum was my favourite and there are so many lakes and spots by the river where you can just sit and do you loads of people do this, you wont be judged., Thats a cool idea ! As being quite introvert myself, traveling alone and doing what you want to do is easier than for some other people. A few days in Berlin, just enjoying the city, being open to whatever happens, listening to music in the evening Im a bit jealous., go for it, five days wont kill you if you hate it, definitely go! if u dont feel like staying in a hostel i totally understand as i am extremely introverted myself but this summer i went on my first ever solo trip and stayed in hostels for days straight and i actually loved it!! i meet so many cool people and we did lots of little trips and activities together and that truly was the highlight of my travel and i cherish these memories so so much! im not saying that u wont have fun by yourself either but at least even if its not this berlin trip give hostels a shot u might surprise yourself"
45,Car rental in Germany,"Hello everyone, I am planning a Christmas trip to Germany and will be renting a car there. I have been getting quotes on rentalcars.com, Europcar and Sixt.

Price wise rentalcars.com with Keddy is by far the cheapest but there is a limited mileage and I cannot seem to find the unlimited mileage extra to add on. Also I couldn’t find many reviews of them so wondering wether they are legit and reliable.

I have actually made a reservation on Europcar as it is fully refundable, I didn’t realise the class I rent actually include a car I do not wish to drive so and I might cancel the reservation for that reason. Anyone have experience with requesting a specific model or requesting not to have a specific model?

In terms of legitimacy comparing Sixt and Europcar what is everyone’s thought? Sixt is non refundable so I reckon it will be a good idea to gather some more opinion before I make my decision. This is the first car rental experience in Europe so any input will be much appreciated. Thank you very much","We rented in Cologne from Enterprise. Highly recommend. The customer service was excellent. We ended up keeping the vehicle an extra week Thalys cancelled our train to Paris and they extended the rental over the phone. They also let us drop it off not in Cologne but in Frankfurt. We rented a Mercedes wagon adults, teens. I think we had requested an Audi, but the Mercedes was nice too. I wouldnt rent anything larger as it was interesting to park in parkades in Paris and Strasbourg., Compare via check.de or a similar pae and set the filters you want. That way, you get cheaper offers. Get full insurance coverage without copay, its not expensive and you dont need to be worried., Have a look at Zestcarrental, a UK broker with good ratings, and recomended by the UK Consumers Association. They rent cars all over the world."
52,Best luxury camp meals,"I’m goin on a trip with one of my buddies that wants to get into backpacking, We are doing a 10 mile loop for 3 days small mileage per day but I do not want to overwhelm him. So my question what is the best camp food I can cook over a fire with a pot/pan I don’t mind carrying in 10lb of food I would like us to eat well so he has a great first experience. So the question is what is YOUR favorite luxury camp meals.","An answer is somewhat contingent on the weather where youll be hiking at. If you can keep food refrigerator cold, your options are limited by your skills as a chef. For camping trips where Im near a car and have limited weight constraints, Ive brought a cast iron and cooked ribeyes, baked potatos in foil near coals, and vegetables. Another easy one is marinating flankskirt steak and making fajitas. You can toast tortillas on a fire and easily dice up an onionbpjalapeo. Breakfast can be eggs, bacon, and fruit... Or you could make pancakes. That being said, for an actual backpacking trip, I always bring Peak freeze dried meals and dessert, which taste nothing like the stereotypical freeze dried food. If you havent actually tried this specific brand, Id recommend getting one and preparing it at home. Your buddy may like this. Also, if yall are drinkers, bring a Nalgene with some nice whiskey and a cigar., Andrew Skurka has some great recipes for backpacking. His beans and rice with cheese and Fritos is one of my standbys I add some precooked hamburger or chicken if temperatures allow. You can freeze raw meat, wrap it in foil and bury it deep in your pack for the first night. Some people do steak but I can never really get it cooked right and steak is kind of bland anyway. I prefer a good sausage and instant mash. Like a sausage designed for braising. Thai packs well. You can get powdered coconut milk at most Asian markets. Peanut butter packets from Justins. Soy from wherever. There are plenty of green curry powders or pad Thai packs. Veggies and dehydrated tofu my coop carries this in bulk with either rice noodles cold soaked or instant jasmine rice. That said, I eat Peak freeze dried meals a lot., Soup is awesome. Put all the ingredients for it in a bag, bring a baguette. At camp, all you have to do is boil water and add your bag o goodies minutes later, voila, soup and baguette. Easy to make, comforting and filling to eat. Not too bulky, not heavy, not labor intensive, can cook over fire or stove. To me, the mecca of luxury camp meals. chefs kiss, Season and grill chicken or steak ahead of time, slice and vacuum seal or pack into a freezer bag if you dont have a sealer. Pack out the protein, chopped raw onions and peppers, oil or butter, shredded cheese, hot sauce and tortillas flour ones travel better than corn. Sautee the meat, onion and peppers in a pan, warm the tortillas on the fire and build yourself some nice backcountry tacos. Easy prep, easy cleanup, big payoff., If the weather is cold enough to keep fresh food chilled, and you dont mind the weight, cowboy stew is my goto option for a tasty fresh meal. Make a one tin foil packet per person with cubed beef or lamb or other meat, carrots, potatoes, onions, seasoning. Cook in the coals of a fire until done. You can also cook corn on the cob in tin foil. If you are really trying to impress, in cold weather, you could pack in steaks and a titanium grill, plus do corn on the cob and baked potatoes in the fire., I always try to plan a gourmet meal for one night when I go hiking with friends. Kabobs are a great option, marinate steak or chicken with veggies in a bag, skewer them and cook over the fire. Bring wipes or sanitizer if youre handling raw meet. Sausages are good and easy, you can cook them ahead of time and then heat up over the fire. If youre bringing a grate, steak is pretty fool proof. Ive done steaks where I prepare them with saltpepper and butter at home and package them and then once you have some decent coals, put them on the grate for a few minutes and enjoy. You can also bring potatoes or corn on the cob, cover in tin foil and toss them onto the coals to cook. If you leave the corn in the husks its almost impossible to overcook. If you have a lightweight pot, Ive heard making stew or chowder is fairly easy. This is definitely something I plan on trying. Bring meatpotatoesveggies and some beef or chicken bouillon cubes and throw everything in with some water and let it cook throughout the day. I usually will bring some brats andor hotdogs too. Theyre super easy to carry and cook over the fire. You can put them on a stick and cook like a marshmallow. Theres barely any wasteclean up involved., Our first night we might grill fish on a small cast iron and do veggies on the side or in the fire foil packets. I also like to do gourmet charcuterie with high end meat, cheese, jam, crackers. But mostly luxury for me ends up being hauling gourmet beer and wine into the woods., Freeze a package of precooked sausages or bratwursts. Theyll thaw in your pack and you can roast them over the fire that evening or the second night. As an added bonus this will open the door to all sorts of jokes about him, your sausage, and the woods. Enjoy!, Filet mignon. Vacuum seal end to end. Wrap in newspaper. MAnytimes.. then paper towels, then foil.,, freeze. Will last for days on trail.put on top of aspergas couscous....dont overcook the beef., We bring deli meat and a can of croissants. Wrap the meat and the croissant around a stick, bring cheese if you like. Cooks the croissant and melts the cheese and the meat is hot and crispy. Pretty great, Depends on your effort level and such but baked potatoes in foil on the fire with grilled steak is pretty epic for night eggs and oatmeal with fixings is an easy but comforting breakfast. Peak Fuel freeze dried meals are pricey but good tasting and texture for light weight options Also dont forget coffeeteahot chocolatecider drinks are also a good comfort in camp, Yeah freeze some steaks or burgers then carry them out for the first night. The other nights good MacCheese like the velvetta shells and cheddar. You can also make cheese steaks out of beef jerky if you can manage carrying buns., If you want to go allout you can do like my brother and I did and carry sushi on ice with a whole watermelon when backpacking in the Tetons. Best sushi Ive ever had in my life, and after soaking the watermelon in a lake, it was the perfect treat on a summer day., I bring frozen, cooked chicken breast, chopped onions and peppers, tortillas and hot sauce for campsite fajitas. Always hits the spot., Hobo packets with filet mignon., Pasta carbonara. Find some type of saltedsmokedcured pork that is in the general family of bacon that you are comfortable with being at the ambient temp for a few days. Saut with a few minced cloves of garlic, then boil round pasta. While past is boiling grate paremesean cheese and mix that with a couple of whole eggs. Once pasta is cooked reserve a little water mix pasta, eggcheese and garlicbacon together. If too thick add a little of water., Pasta carbonara.

If too thick add a little of water., Reply to your actual question premake breakfastrgular burritos and wrap them well in heavy duty foil. Freeze them depending on outside temps and when you want to eat them. Place them in the coals of the fire. Easy and delicious. My personal thoughts I think that if he is interested in getting into backpacking, then you may be going about things the wrong way. I think you should focus on simplicity. What youre describing will not translate to longer trips with higher mileage From your comments, it sounds like you need some more experience with freeze dried backpacking meals. Saying they are gross and that MREs taste better just means that you havent tried anything good. Peak Refuel makes excellent tasting meals that have great caloriesweight ratio and require less water. If you dont want to spend that kind of money, introduce him to the joy of ramen, instant mashed potatoes, and packing out subs or something for the first night I think its better to start sooner rather than later in minimizing the weight and amount of gear you carry for backpacking. This could also be a good time for you to take a fresh look at your own gear Have fun!, Chorizo, dry cured, cheese, cheddar or similar hard cheese, and tortillas. Quesadillas, foil over a grill over a fire, add almost anyhting, we prefry onions and peppers, and this is one of my favorties and the base ingredients will ast days on trail."
53,2 week solo trip in Latin America - where to go?,"Hey fellow travelers! I'm absolutely passionate about exploring new countries, and this time, I'm considering venturing solo in January/February in Latin America. I'll be in Colombia with my boyfriend in February, visiting his family, but before that, I want to do a solo adventure for 1 to 2 weeks.

I've traveled solo before in Southeast Asia. In Latin America I've been to Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama (and Colombia) before, but always with a companion. This time, I want to discover a brand-new country.

My interests revolve around nature, wildlife, hiking, and getting to know different cultures. I'm particularly keen on visiting national parks, beaches, and if possible even spotting whales and turtles.

I'm seeking recommendations from other travelers who've explored Latin America. Where should I head that's not only perfect for a 1 to 2 week route but also safe for a solo woman like me? I'd greatly appreciate your insights, advice, and personal stories!","How about Ecuador? Hiking Cotopaxi, Quilatoa, wildlife Isla de la Plata or Galapagos if you have the budget, beaches Montanita and nearby, the Amazon jungle, and other nice nature places like Banos and Mindo. I did most of that by myself as a solo female and felt very safe though you have to use Latin America city common sense in Quito., Hey so as other people are mentioning Ecuador. I went last year and felt so safe. Safer than say Peru. However, I would avoid Guayaquil, Ecuador. Guayaquil is being hit very hard by street crime and cartel related fights. I went to Quito Baos was planning my next trip last year and I also read that Guayaquil doesnt have that much to see so youre not missing anything there., Peru is the best South American country., Ecuador is awesome and I agree with all your recommendations except would avoid montanita its become a shithole recently full of junkies and passport bros, Thanks for the tips! Which month did you travel there? And how are the distances between the places?, Cuenca was cool. Canoa as well, Agree on avoiding montanita. The rest of ecuador is beautiful but the beaches feel unsafe and are not beautiful, The distances are not that far thats why it would be a great trip for just one or two weeks. Everything is just a night Bus away from each other. Ecuador would also be my suggestion. Small and really diverse., I was there in April and May. Things are fairly close. The Amazon trip was a long bus ride each way from Quito I did night bus and day bus but worth it. I did go to the Montanita area through a short flight from Quito to Guayaquil though and then a bus. I see other people hating on Montanita, and its definitely a party town, but I didnt feel unsafe and thought the beach was ok personally. But there are other smaller recommended towns, especially for surfing, in that area but I just dont know their names off the top of my head because I didnt go."
805,Family Vacation,"Hey all! Not sure if this is the right place to ask and I’m on mobile, so feel free to delete if I’m in violation.

We are in the process of planning our annual family vacation and I was hoping for some ideas from the travel experts. Here’s what I would like:

U.S., Coastal/lake/beach, Close to a casino, Shopping and lots of outdoor activities 

So far I’ve come up with Lake Tahoe (NV), Rehoboth Beach (DE), and Hollywood Beach (FL)

I would love any personal feedback from the three I chose or additional recommendations","South Lake Tahoe is great. Lots of activities outside of gambling and so many lakes around aside from Lake Tahoe. Laughlin, NV is also an option ... its a tiny Las Vegas on the Colorado River., HattiesburgBiloxi Mississippi? Casinos, water activities, and some higher end southern food. Cant speak to the shopping., Theres no gambling in Delaware. There is an outlet mall nearby."

1699,Solo Trip with Dog,"Taking a solo trip with my dog around Thanksgiving. I understand some National Parks only let you take dogs in specific areas. I have about 10 days and could potentially extend 1-2 days if necessary. Any suggestions or considerations?

Plan:
Day 1 - drive 10-12 hours (sleep at rest stops)
Day 2 - drive 10-12 hours and reach Albuquerque
Day 3 - Monument Valley
Day 4 - Capital Reef to Bryce, stay in Hatch
Day 5 - Grand Canyon, stay in Sedona
Day 6 - Phoenix
Day 7 - White Sand Dunes and Carlsbad Caverns
Day 8 - Fort Worth, eat at Goldee’s BBQ
Day 9 - drive 10-12 hours home","Bringfido.com and use Google for dog parks. I travel full time with my dog and theres no way hes going to ride for hours without getting out for at least or hours at a park or a dog park. Unless your dog is like really old or something., Looks awesome! Can I recommend going north on the way in through southerm CO. You could check out black canyon of the Gunnison most underrated NP and great sand dunes NP. Also, your route would also take you close to Mesa Verde NP. All are worth the few extra miles youll be adding, and then you can head right to Utah. If you have a dog, I really recommend this route. See below. BC of the G allows dogs on the rim on a leash going to the bottom requires a permit and a serious hikeclimb Great sand dunes allows dogs on leash up to the first sand ridge that includes second highest sand dune in N America. I have pics of my dog and I up there. I did most of these places youre going even without my added pieces with my dog so if you have any specific questions, LMK, Good trip! I hit most of those places on my roadtrip around. If you can, I would recommend a stop in Zion, dont know their dog stance though., Dont forget horseshoe bend in page,AZ if you have time., Im planning a trip so I guess I understand why this thread pops up for me, but good god why is of this thread just idiots asking where you should visit? like how dumb are you??? Its not hard to find stops. I just dont get it., deleted, Looks amazing! I also have a road trip planned with Goldees as a stop haha, I suggest you cover a lot less territory for to days and stop and enjoy it. Thats just ugly highway driving and it is ugly. I drive from New England to Los Angeles a few times a year but it takes me weeks LOL depending where I am and what I want to see. Yes Im retired so I help the time but the same rules should apply for your trip. Thats a lot of driving, way too much driving for the time frame allotted. Cut it in half, stop hike or just relax and youll enjoy the experience much much more. Doesnt matter where you are in Europe, New England or Southern California the same rule applies.. everybody gets hungry to see way too much and then you just end up in the car. A day off someplace super long walks with the dog just sitting and relaxing is all part of the vacation too otherwise you can just go online and look at pictures, Eat at Tin Can Alley in ABQ., Definitely going to cut those hour days into hour increments. This is a great suggestion. Thanks!, Youve never asked others for suggestions?, Explain this, Hitting the dog parks is a huge plus, you get to get out and stretch your legs and your dog gets to have a few friends for a while. I forgot to mention, trails in national parks are usually a big NoNo for dogs, even on a leash. But right outside of national parks you usually find public land of some sort. Use I Overlander app to find any type of spot like that before you get into the park."
1711,Planning a family road trip from Vancouver to Quebec then Nova Scotia while our teens still like us - advice on route?,"Our family is planning a 3-4 week trip to visit family in Quebec and Nova Scotia *this summer. After looking at the logistics of flights, car rentals, dog sitter at home, etc, we are weighing the other option of driving, amd making a road trip out of it. 

Both of our kids are keen (14 and 16) and we feel like we may only have one more shot at an epic cross Canada adventure before they are launched.

We are considering going through the US (I90) on the way there, and coming home the Canada route. This way we can check out some sites in Montana like Yellowstone.  Also, gas, motels, food etc seem to still be a bit cheaper. 

We would have out camping stuff with is, but aim to stay in hotels at least 50% of the time. From Quebec to Halifax we are with friends and family.

Any advice on things to consider or check out? If we drive, we’ll take 4 weeks. 

Thanks all,","If it works in your schedule, I would recommend Bic National Park Parc national du Bic just west of Rimouski. Its gorgeous but also very small so you wont feel like youre missing out with a short stay. Campground reservations at SEPAQ for next summer just opened this week so you still might have a chance to get a spot. Also, you mentioned in a comment youll be travelling late July and early August. Be aware that most people in Quebec take their vacation during construction holidays, which will be from July st to August rd next summer. I would strongly advise to avoid these dates to do anything remotely touristic in Quebec during that time as everything will be booked and packed with people. I would also recommend stopping by the great lakes for camping. If you leave the US from Detroit, maybe a quick stop to Point Pelee National Park so you can see the southernmost point of continental Canada and then camp at Long Point Provincial Park. The campgrounds are right next to white sandy beaches and bright blue lakes, it feels like youre by the sea., Thats a long trip for teenagers! There would be plenty to see on I, but also lots and lots of stretches of nothing. Same on the way back in Canada after Alberta. I am assuming this is planned for the summer when the kids are not attending school. Thats also going to be when it will be tough to get campgrounds and cheaper hotels. I would say it might be better to do separate trips QuebecNova Scotia and then the PNW and all the Canadian NPs around Banff on another trip., Is gas really cheaper in the USA? its .g in Chicago, so .USL say, which would be .CDN, right? check my maths. The exchange rate is a bummer. But might be worth it to check out some stuff, although its a big commit to go south of the Great Lakes, and thats mostly urban terrain vs more parks and stuff to the north. Youd be dropping to about the latitude of New York or Eureka Calif on the west coast. Its about the same driving time, interestingly enough, to the hour per google. Three weeks would be rushed, even four is is tight since just the shortest route to Halifax is hours, or two weeks of hr driving days, so little time to veer off course. And the route through the US would be mostly freeway, not the most exciting driving. Not to discourage you, but a month is a long time on the road especially if you have to move every day., things KOA campgrounds offer tent sites and cabins with many activities. This might lower your stay costs. . Many people do not realize how big rodeo events are. Some highschools in the Midwest have teams. This may present an interesting event and the ability to interact with some of the animals involved. . Amature radio since this is all about communications,your whole family can participate. You could even make it a family activity. This could give your children something else to do while you drive.....talk to other people nyes, I am talking world wide talking. As a parent, this may give you an electronic leash to allow your children to roam and give you the sense you can still protect them.

Unfortunately the timing will put us squarely in the busy season in Quebec but, we will be staying with family at least., Thanks for the response. It will be from mid July to mid August. So we hope to start planning soon once we decide a path.

2619,Best place to go for Simchat Torah for women in Jerusalem?,"Hi! My best friend made Aaliyah this year and I am visiting her during Simchat Torah. We are wondering where is a good place for fun dancing and partying on Simchat Torah for women? We are open to synagogues or other spaces which are gender-segregated or mixed. We just want a fun, Jewish, welcoming environment where everyone is spending the whole night dancing, singing, doing Jewish songs and tfilot etc with the Torah.","Yedidia in Baqa has sifrei Torah on the womens side of the mechitza, IME the biggest factor in keeping dancing going for more than a couple of hakafot., Sorry is Yedidia a synagogue? Is Baqa a city? Would you mind sending me the address, this sounds really interesting and I appreciate the info!!, BaqaBaka is a neighborhood next to Talpiot in Jerusalem. I think Yedidia egalitarian Orthodox synagogue, IIRC is on Gad Street or an adjacentperpendicular street I was there years ago when I stayed with a friend for Simchat Torah."
2699,Cross border car rental suggestions 3-4 days trip,"Hello everyone

I am a Canadian and planning to drive from Budapest to Vienna, Prague (maybe not that close) and then back to Budapest. We are 3 people

I am spending most time in Budapest and Italy this time but I want to do like a short road trip like driving around for a change, to cities closer to Budapest.

I looked at Autoeurope and did a search and found this dryyve website , Suzuki viatara Automatic, they're charging \\~160 EUROS(with lazy pack)  with unlimited mileage, additional drivers + one time cross border 99EUROS fees. I don't know if there can be any other hidden costs or any other company which can be better than this overall?

Thanks in advance!","You sound like a masochist. Why not take a train or fly? It will be much cheaper using a car in Budapest, Vienna, and Prague is not practical at all. Parking its self is extremely difficult and public transit is king downtown. For cross border, maybe Sixt if you insist. Edit Try Europcar as well maybe., I knew that North Americans have a different perception of distance than us, but did you really call Budapest Vienna Prague Munich a short road trip?, the hidden costs are if you choose the wrong rental company. they will scrutinize the auto for damage of any amount and charge you for it. do proper research on a travelers forum rather than a city sub. but i agree with others that this road trip idea is foolish considering you are planning to do it this month where there is a possibility of extreme winter weather and a certainty of short days., I have done Budapest, Vienna and Prague on days and it was really short.. The train is nice. Dont think there trio will be better for a road trip to be honest, I dont see why they would charge you extra for crossing the border, looks like a scam. You can freely travel inside the EU, and insurances cover EU wide by default. Im traveling cross border frequently with rental and havent had to pay anything extra once. Id use a larger one like Avis, Hertz, or Sixt, where policies are created and enforced by the owning branches. You can try and ask rcartalkhungary theyre a quite nice bunch of guys, although Im not sure if theyre familiar with rental. Also, as others said, train connections and schedules are quite good if youre willing to sacrifice some comfort. Inside larger cities, youll need to travel by public transport anyway if youre planning on preserving your sanity., I have an even better idea. You could do Canada, US and Mexico in three days. Its only countries but you will equally see nothing and you get to save on the plane ticket., I always use sunnycars, they also insure everything even if the local car dealer makes you pay something, youll get reimbursed via them. Its like a booking.com for car rentals. Youll still end up getting your car via Europcar and such, Id say pick cities that are somewhat close to each other BP and Prague, BP and Vienna, Vienna and Prague, Munich and Vienna, Munich and Prague and spend days in one of them, then take the train takes a few hours, which is much better than the hassle of renting a car and driving to the other city, and spend days there, then fly home. I know its tempting to visit as many places as possible, but the things that will happen to you if you stick to your plan will probably be these . You will spend a big chunk of your time on a highway, where theres nothing to see except for gas stations and the occasional wind turbine. . In the remaining time, you will barely have enough time to really experience each city you will probably rush to the city centre, where youll see the same baroqueart noveaugothic buildings, eat similar food and drink similar drinks. These cities are all in Germaninfluenced Central Europe, to a foreigner they are not that different from each other if you look superficially not even for me, a local tbh. Like imagine you have half a day in Calgary, Vancouver, Seattle and Portland each. What will you see? If you really want to explore the things that are worth exploring in each city, you need at least a day or two for that. . If you dont have experience driving in Europe, you will probably be stressed. VERY stressed. This is not North America where roads are wide, parking spaces many and cities are designed for driving. Imagine trying to parallel park on a street thats like steps wide because it was designed in for drving oxen, while scooters are buzzing around you and cyclists can appear out of nowhere, any time. And then when you get back to your car, you see that you have a flat tire happened to me, and your whole trips ruined. So just do yourself a favor pick two cities, spend days in one, walk around instead of driving, explore the the interesting layers under the surface, then hop on a train, sit down in the dining car, have a beer, take a nap in your seat, wake up in city number and start over, then fly home., Thanks for the hint. I will check that one. What do you think of klasswagen abd Dryyve an feedback?, Haha , not Munich , its too much. But Budapest as starting point Vienna stay Prague stay Bratislavastay back to Budapest. That seems doable to me and we are drivers., Thanks for pointing it out. I will post in other forum., I am spending most time in Budapest and Italy this time but wanted to do like a short road trip like driving around for a change to cities closer to Budapest. But plan to do other European countries with sufficient time on next trip. But I will consider what you suggested. Thanks for the feedback, Thanks for pointing out the main companies. Just out of curiosity I checked for Hertz , cross border policy, they also have some charges as well under cross border policy, idk why its like that..... Vehicles may be driven into Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy excluding Sicily, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. An additional fee of . including tax per rental applies if you wish to drive abroad., I know what you mean and I am aware of it. I am only doing specific cities just for a change, the city vibes and a road trip. The long trip plan, maybe next time...., Thank so much for detailed explanation. I am now reconsidering this driving plan. But in the entire plan I was actually planning to do cities only i.e Prague and Vienna, spending like . day each. BP is just a pick up and drop off point. For the driving experience, no I dont have but youre it can be stressful then. Ok may I ask if I want to drive around closer to Budapest, which city would it be for a wonderful road trip experience? Last thing, you mentioned that one can drive and then return the car in other foreign country, correct? Ill check that too., Never heard of either., Yeah, it is doable, but you will be sitting in your car for at least hours, which is an entire day out of the . You wont have the time to properly explore either of the mentioned cities in such short time. Your entire vacation would feel like you are rushing from city to city., Im not sure. Maybe its a surcharge to cover communication and documentation costs in case something happens? I looked it up now. Its the same for me, but I had no idea its in place., Well if you really insist on driving and you want to include Budapest, Id have the following suggestions for a road trip Start in Vienna, spend a day there, then drive south to Lake Balaton, then along by the lake. Its a big lake and its north shore is pretty nice, there are places to stop at like Keszthely which has a nice castle and a thermal lake, theres the Kli basin, vineyards, Balatonfred, Veszprm, Szkesfehrvr, the old coronation city etc., then you can take highway number to Budapest, spend a day there too, then drive back to Vienna on the highway, it takes , hours from downtown Budapest to Schwechat airport if theres no traffic. Or you can drive from Budapest to Prague via Vienna but then you probably dont want to drive back, as thats like hours of driving, so youd have to drop off the car in Prague. Mind you, this is also easier to do by train. Or you can start in Vienna and drive to Prague via Cesky Krumlov, Ceske Budejovice or Pilsen, that might be worth the drive as well. Yes, you can drop your car off in a different country, but that aint cheap. Ive just checked and if you rent even a small car in Budapest and you drop it off in Prague, it will cost you at least CAD a day, and thats without gas, road tolls or parking fees., And how about just doing cities Prague and Vienna ? Hows that sound?"
3687,Travel tips no one asked for - Seoul vs. Tokyo,"People compare Seoul and Tokyo a lot. Here’s my round up of what’s better and worse for each…

COST: Seoul. It’s not very expensive. you can get a decent hotel for like $30-50usd a night. public transit, food, alcohol are all pretty cheap. Tokyo gets pricey fast by comparison. 

PUBLIC TRANSIT: Seoul, by a slight margin. The metro system is amazing and easy to navigate. The busses are great too. Tokyo’s is remarkable and fascinating but can be very very confusing if you don’t speak Japanese.

WEATHER: Tokyo. Winter is prohibitively cold in Seoul.

FOOD: Tokyo. Not even really comparable IMO. Food in Seoul is good, food in Tokyo is better than anywhere else on Earth.

FOREIGNER FRIENDLY: Seoul. Everything is bilingual English/Korean in terms of signage, menus etc. Neither city has a high level of English proficiency but Seoul’s is marginally better.

PEOPLE: Tokyo. Japanese people are unimaginably welcoming and Tokyo feels absurdly safe. Korean people are more distant (to foreigners) and at nighttime there are too many drunk people around, it can feel sketchy. 

NIGHTLIFE: Seoul. Koreans know how to party. Tokyo felt sleepy during the week. 


These are just my observations. I truly cant say which one I like more, both are amazing and worth thoroughly visiting.","Ive also done both and think that this is a great take. Thanks for the post, Seoul was more my vibe, but japan is a nicer place to vacation., I disagree on some things, but its probably due to me being SEAsian from a rd world country and the years I went to Tokyo and SeoulBusan for context. Accommodation Korea has comparatively cheaper and larger hotels, even if Im unsure if they were love hotels, but compared to Japans tiny business hotel, Ill take it. Food Really subjective, but its Japan for me cause everything is fresh and have I feel greater quality ingredients wise. Korean food feels way expensive for the quality tbh, when I can get the same quality at home for cheaper. Or possibly there not enough good Japanese places in my country, and maybe having more decent Korean restos heres. I do like Koreas culture of having a lot of sidedishes, but those probably what makes it more expensive. Navigation google maps in Japan is so good and can provide step by step guide on where to go, hurts my feet though, coming from a car centric country. Korea, due to war with the north, has outdated google map data and requires another app like naver to navigate, but they do have more escalators in their stations though. Long distance train quality was a step down in Korea I feel, specifically Busan one, but our trip also coincided with an event, with there not having enough seating for everyone on a long trip. Still way better from where Im from with scooter hell and vehicular pollution almost everywhere, so cant really complain. English infrastructure I think Japan has more available english signs and menus in my experience. Maybe its line dependent, but their train announcements cycle through English as well, compared to Korea where theres none iirc. Koreans do have more english speaking people and sort of understands more, in terms of the average person. I also have a bit of bias that I personally feel hiragana and katakana are easier to read than hangul. People Korea was weird but in a good way, we were far from East Asian looking but people would try to talk with us in Korean all the time. We would tell them we couldnt understand, and they would either apologize, situationally laugh of the mistake or would try to talk in english, but in general more friendly feeling and helped us out even without asking when we looked lost once. Japan feels more cold and apathetic I feel. I get it since I once worked in customer service and also coming from a homogenous country. But when something goes off script they sort of shortcircuit, for a lack of a better term, would pause and look at you in panic or frustration, with you most of the time have to compromise. Im an introvert so honestly prefer it, but IFF everything goes well. Culture wise I biasedly prefer Japan games, anime, etc, but not enough to actually live there only for vacations. Korea feels really brand, class and looks conscious for me, expensive cars and luxury brands are everywhere, could never fit in with my broke ass there. Might be the areas we went through, but both countries shops and restaurants do kinda closes too early. Japan in particular also opens way too late with earliest at mostly am, couldnt fit more restaurants to try out for breakfast. Way different to where Im from where people are out and about as early as am to as late as mn. Seeing from your post OP, Taiwans my next travel goal, hopefully can get the opportunity for next year or to go., I lived in Korea for a year and have visited many times since, spent a total of about two years there. Never lived in Japan but all visits combined have spent probably close to a year there now, although much more time outside of Tokyo than in the city. Agree with pretty much everything you said. Edit Actually I dont really find the nighttime drunkenness sketchy, but thats probably because Im a bit of a drunk myself. One thing that works in Koreas favour that I havent seen anyone mention is how easy it is to learn hangul. The first time I went there twentyplus years ago I had a little pocket Korean phrasebook with a guide on how to read hangul in the time it took me to fly from Vancouver to Incheon I had learned how to read all of the characters. Obviously I didnt know the meanings of many words but being able to read the characters phonetically is huge in itself. Good luck trying that with Japanese., Interesting. Ive been to both and was just in Seoul a few months ago. The food in Seoul is amazing. Its so fresh. Tokyo does get the edge because, well, its Tokyo, but I had amazing meals in Seoul. Also, the food is more approachable. Fried Chicken and beer is everywhere!? Haha. Amazing. The coffee in Seoul is better! I thought the people in Seoul and Tokyo were both so friendly. My wife was pregnant in Seoul and there were always pregnancy seats for her on the subway. Once a random kid was on his phone in a pregnancy seat not paying attention with the subway full. An older man nudged him and asked him to get up, then motioned for my wife to sit down. Ill never forget that. Japanese is easier to pronounce for me than Korean. It took me all week to nail down how the hell to pronounce hello and thank you. Also the bowing is such an easy way to express gratitude, hello, goodbye. Easier to communicate in Japan. Theres no sumo in Seoul., I visited both this September hard disagree on public transport in Seoul, and hotels we had great accommodation, cleanliness and service for a good price in a hostel in Tokyo Ginza and AWFUL conditions in a more expensive hostel in Seoul Myeongdong. I found Tokyo much more foreigner friendly, signage in Tokyo was immaculate and always bilingual, as well as announcements on the underground. Seoul was not always bilingual and important announcements line splitting and so on were not always in English. We ended up in unnecessarily dumb situations because we do not understand Korean. ALSO GOOGLE MAPS !!! Huge huge huge aspect of getting around and we found the Korean alternatives unusable as we dont understand Korean , I travel to Seoul and Tokyo regularly for business and pleasure. Some thoughts I dont think you can necessarily get a decent hotel room in Seoul for USD a night, unless were counting a windowless love motel room as a decent hotel room, and even then USD wouldnt get you much if anything Tokyo has an edge in the winter, but really should be off limits JuneAugust because of how hot and humid it gets Neither city is particularly foreigner friendly by the standards of a place like Singapore, evident from use of the term foreigner friendly itself, they both have their own insularity, cultural and linguistic bridges. I dont think everything is bilingual accurately describes Seoul by any means, its not Singapore, Hong Kong or Kuala Lumpur. People are roughly the same insular, polite and not really that interested in mingling with you on the whole, though Koreans typically speak better English than the Japanese I agree strongly that things are open much later, including shops, restaurants and nightlife My own thoughts Seoul is more fun if youre with somebody, especially if you want to go out Tokyo has better architecture and is more puttogether as a city, while Seoul is a bit grittier and a bit more inyourface Nice hotels and taxis in Tokyo are incredibly expensive, Seoul is much better in this regard, I really have to disagree about the people. Japanese do I lot of seemingly nice acts in public bowing, talking quietly, respecting personal space, generally having good manners, etc., but they will very often try to completely avoid any social interaction with you. Koreans might be louder and not as polite they are not rude either, though, however if you want to talk with them whether for assistance or just a chat, its very easy to do so. They are open for conversation with a foreigner, even if they only speak Korean they will happily translate with Papago. I think people often mistake the culture of politeness in Japan for the people being nice, but in my experience with perhaps the exception of Osaka, its actually a very cold and distant culture., lol. The only one id disagree with is Public Transit. Pricewise, Seoul is much cheaper and easier to navigate due to the entire system being covered by Korail., tokyo is the best. You will never go wrong with Japan. Ive been there times already. Ill never get tired of it, People probably mentioned it already, but public transit foreigner friendly part was so much more convenient for me in Tokyo ? Like, finding any place on Google maps is a nightmare in Korea, you need to use Naver Kakao maps, which is really not convenient. And even if you can find the place you want on google maps, you cant even pick the walking itinerary. Otherwise I guess both cities are both as good, but different, it just depends on what kind of experience youre looking for, Ive travelled and lived in both hats off for a great hot take! Though depends on your palate I prefer Korean food theres more flavour to it. In short Japanese food may be a bit flatbland but they pride in freshness and quality, whilst Korean food has loads of garlic, ginger and the works., deleted, Where did you find hotels at that price in Seoul? I remember finding lots of nice hotels in Busan for that price, but not in Seoul. My experience was that it was easier to find an ok budget hotel in Tokyo. At least in August and September this year. In November it looked more expensive in Tokyo too., My perspective as a frequent business traveler to both places, I love both. Food SeoulKorea has better spiced food while TokyoJapan feels simple and fresh. Fire and Ice. After I have a lot of Korean food, I would want to have some Japanese food. And vice versa. Now if we consider availability of other non local cuisines, Tokyo takes the gold by a mile. Transportation Korea is simpler for tourist going to main tourist spots but Tokyo gets you anywhere better. I had to take taxi in Seoul more often than when I visit Tokyo. Cost Seoul wins, but not by much. Weather I agree. Been to both locations in all seasons. Winter in Seouls winter was brutal for someone who grew up in tropical weather, and Tokyos summer is going to be tough to handle for those who love colder drier weather. Foreigner friendly Easier to get help in Tokyo. Seoul was fine but in Tokyo they have no problem going out of their ways to help you out. Nightlife I think this one depends on who you know and what you like ..., deleted, Personally I feel English is more widely accepted in Tokyo than in Seoul but I think it depends which parts youre in., I always found the Korean to be much friendlier and welcoming that the Japanese personally. Maybe faker, I dont know and dont really care. They are just better people to be around generally. Also, ENGLISH the younger Koreans are much more proficient in the language that their Japanese counterparts. I could easily find people who spoke very good English in Incheon, whereas the same in Tokyo is very rare. CLEANLINESS Japan, by a mile. Korean streets can be filthy and the concrete infrastructures often look awful., Ive never been to Japan but lived in Korea and I love Seoul. I returned as a tourist not that many years ago and had such a good time. People really overlook Korea as a destination in my opinion., The transport in Seoul isnt marginally better than Tokyo, its significantly better by leaps and bounds. Everything is clearly labeled in English. Theres no having to figure out which tickets for which lines, etc. Subway cars are much more spacious and less cramped feeling. This isnt even a close match."
4326,Best place to find travelers w similar timelines/budgets/plans?,"Hi there,

I know it sounds really dumb and unsafe to look online for “fellow travelers” that want to go to the same destination to experience the same things, but I was wondering where people find traveling buddies? Does Reddit make a good place? Any other place of budget conscious travelers who aren’t going to make things weird?

I have been looking at turkish ham-am videos and want to plan a trip to turkey or other destinations with ham-ams with either a fellow female or a couple. I’m pretty chill with my vacation plans (I don’t tend to want to go to all the tourist spots or even explore too much/ be on foot a ton when I’m in a new place; I know this sounds like a waste of a plane ticket but to me it’s less stressful than pursuing a bucket list of things to do in places); I am curious if anyone checked forums or Reddit subs for their travel friends who want to do similar things as them as they plan their trips/accommodations or collaborated on similar travel plans? 

Or are these things reserved strictly to close/local friends?
What sorts of vetting would you do before meeting up with someone with similar travel plans at the destination? 

Should I just buck up and plan to have a hamam trip by myself or with someone more familiar to me? Keep in mind this plan isn’t solid right now, more of a pipe dream at this point but it’s be nice to have another goal to save up for! It’s the thing that keeps me going!","Tbh, why dont you just go the biggest hostel you can find, socialise for a couple days and continue traveling with whomever you like the most? You might end up alone or have to compromise on your routes but I doubt youll find a stranger online that wants to go to the exact same places and whom you vibe with..., Like another poster said, stay at a large partysocial hostel near your destination and get to know people there. Mention that youre going to xyz and invite them to come with. Theres a sub called rtravelpartners you can try. Theres also an app called travelbff where you can fill out a profile and it connects you to other travelers near you. Seems interesting but Ive never used it., G Adventures has great reviews and at least in the past, the prices were surprisingly reasonable. Otherwise, what the other person said, find the biggest hostel in the main city of the country and BE SOCIAL and talk to EVERYONE., Well sometimes thats why people join things like this. Find interests znd comment, you never know if youll meet someone one day or not., In addition to hostels, you can try Solo Female Travellers Network and Host A Sister on Facebook., Hostels are great for this! Often they will have WhatsApp groups you can join once youre there so you could message in there to see if anybody would like to join you for an activity on the day, otherwise just socialise around the hostel and youre sure to meet sooo many people in the same boat as you. Theres also a lot of Facebook groups you can join such as girls love travel for meeting travel buddies"
4382,Looking for destination/activity ideas for my first solo trip during my birthday,"So I'm traveling from the states, midwest, Kalamazoo, MI. I'll only have 3 to 4 nights, last weekend in March, but I figured it'd be a good opportunity for my first solo trip. Flying is totally cool. I just really want nature, hiking, something beautiful, even beachy is fine with me. Other things I dig are fun night life, museums, good food, botanical gardens. Any tips or ideas are appreciated! Just to add- I'll probably be renting a car wherever I decide on. Also, the easier travels, the better. I'd prefer nothing too lengthy travel wise, and of course.... as cheap as we can make it, ya girl is not too picky haha","Pick up an allegiant flight out of Grand Rapids and go to Nashville. Only stay there for one day for the nightlife, but there is plenty of history and nature, What about Washington DC? Have the option of driving or flying there. Not necessarily cheap to stay in but all the Smithsonian museums and governmental buildings are free. Good public transportation too, no need for a car., Id stick with a short flight without connections or drive for only nights. Especially if that includes your travel days. Chicago, NYC, DC, Philadelphia are quick flights you can do train or drive to Chicago. No need for a car in any of those places although you would be in big cities. Indiana Dunes had some nice hiking when we went there several years ago. March is a bit off season but you can go to Traverse City or the UP. Lots of nice scenery there but the beaches will be cold. If you fly, consider driving to Grand Rapids or Detroit for better prices and flight options. Edited for duplicate info, Or do the same but go to Phoenix instead., Great option but I would look for a flight since its going to be about a hour drive not including breaks., As you know in March in MI you def not went to go north of where you are. Fun to find a town where you dont need to rent a car."

I would add that upon venturing out on a long, lightpacked trip I will make the effort to buy some new garments, especially socks, underwear, tshirts, and shoes but broken in. I will surely wear things out when worn repeatedly for months, so best to start fresh. Look for things that are easily washed, quick to dry, and worn wrinkle free but for gods sake, you dont need to buy those silly travel cloths to wear around Paris. Its a civilized societyyoure not on a bush safari., For all the people leaving their old clothes in their hotel rooms, please notify the staff that you wont be needing it back. Many hotels have a policy of keeping forgotten items for months before throwing them out. Its a hassle. We have to label the items and describe the item and person who left it there. The whole process is annoying af. And we get very annoyed with guests who dont notify us, Get a kindle., Good tips, apart from wearing jeans on a flight. Screw that., Do you pack extra shoes or just the ones u wear to the airport?, Pack old clothes. Holey socks, unobvious stained tshirts, faded pajama bottomsas you wear them for a bit, eventually leave them in your hotel and buy new where you are at. Good way to refresh your wardrobe. As clothes get tattered, we even put them in our vacation pile so we know what to bring. For our kids, we even bring clothes that are a bit too snug. Not uncomfortable, just growing out of., Hey! If youd rather go to a proper gym while on the road, instead of a hotel gym check out www.FTNSS.fit. Theyre a new company, but all they do are shortterm gym memberships for travelers., What are you meant to do when you wash your one pair of jeans? Go naked?, No advice wrt a phone, toiletries, sewing kit, medical stuff, shorts, shirt, or jacket, but another ad for the same blog theyve spammed many times before. Cool., I totally agree haha, the khaki colors clothes are all over the place. I like to wear jeans and a black shirt. It works the best, but I would recommend getting clothes that are odorless. Makes a huge difference, wearing synthetic and sweat makes for a smelly situation. Also, I totally agree with buying new stuff. I think once every months replacing your wardrobe is actually a good enough time frame if you continually wear the clothes over and over. Thank you for the tips How long have you been traveling for?, Oh that is actually are ally good tip. Thank you for that, I never even thought about that. But in saying that I usually just give away my personal clothes or throw them out. If they managed months with me, they deserve a good retirement haha, Yeh, kindles are great, so light and tons of books. Great suggestion. Do you use it often when you travel? and whats your appeal for the Kindle?, Yeah Im more of a shorts guy, but when Im a bit cold, jeans are nice to stay warm, Honestly I have one pair of shoes, I wear joggers that also dont look like joggers, Navy blue ones, as they can second as ok looking shoes, specially when I wear jeans and a nice shirt. Hope that helps , Yeah I love replacing old clothes on my journeys. There is a moment where you realise that the shirt or pants have run its course and then you just buy new ones and the freshness of them is so nice. I found that clothes companies are making worse quality clothes these days, so I am a bit dissapointed in that, I would love a hoodie that looks great even after a year or something. So far the best I managed was months. But thats because I wear it almost daily, Pack shorts , I dont carry a sewing kit but I think that is a great idea as I have needed it a few times in the past but I just always forget to buy one and pack it. , Yeah, thats the best way to do it I work in Denmark, so most people here are fairly wealthy. I imagine that in more poor countries, some hotel workers might wantneed the clothes or other items left behind, All about the lightweight track pantsjoggers with zips., You can buy higher quality clothes. But that costs. The other bad thing for clothing is washing machine. So try the best you can to wash infrequently. Let the hoodie air out as much as you can. Also the dryer is brutal, I let many things air dry and then put them in for minutes to fluff them up get rid of wrinkles."
9894,"Best place to go ""monk mode"" for 3 months?","If you needed to go someplace to focus on a long project for 3 months. I would like a reasonably quiet neighborhood where I can rent a nice place to just focus completely on something important. Other than working, I would like to have abundant and affordable fresh fruit and vegetables and maybe some type of physical activity (not hiking) that I could do when I need to get away from my desk and clear my head. TIA.","Small town Japan. I recommend Kumamoto lived there for years during covid., Go to Seoul rent a place near the han river or any quiet neighborhood, basically anywhere not Itawan, Hongdae, or Gangnam, and rent a bike, then go biking on the very scenic bike routes of seoul and beyond. Lots of airbnbs are set up for college students studying so you can actually get really nice areas to work in your airbnb itself. And the cafes in seoul are some of the best to work in in the world., Cant you monk mode just about anywhere? I always thought it was more of a mindset, not a location., Monk mode can be done anywhere. I did mine in the suburb of Palermo, Italy. If you are not going to enjoy the facilities, you might as well find the cheapest place possible., East Asia has very quiet cities., If you like the waterswimming, a smallish coastal city might do you good. Nayarit and Puerto Escondido were quite lovely and its probably a good time to go from now until early summer., Canary Islands or Madeira could be a good option., Rural Turkey, Luang Prabang Laos. Extremely affordable accommodation and excellent food options. Already a ton of monks there too. Very quiet chill atmosphere. If I had a mo project to hunker down on, thats where Id go. Excellent street markets each morning and night. A lot of physical activity to do, and easy access to other areas as it has an airport and a high speed train connecting it to the outside world., I did my monk mode in a tiny town in Maine for a year... though wouldnt recommend it haha. Now that Im in Puerto Rico, Id pick somewhere more like this. Someplace with nice warm weather every day. Japan might be cool, but with PR if you are US citizen you can stay longer without needing to mess with visas.... So, yea, I think Id probably just do PR, still American and familiar enough and then not need to worry about time and visas and all that BS. Its cheaper than a lot of places on the mainland and if you stick to the west coast its more touristy and safer. Though youd need to get a car probably. So way more of an investment that doesnt make sense if its only months. Hmmm., A monastery, Pai thailand, Not to hijack this thread but does anyone have recommendations for this but in Europe specifically?, Sri lankan mountains, Rishikesh India best place to do it Beatles did monk mode here Steve jobs also mark zuckerburg also lived here for a short period in the same state as in Rishikesh that is uttarakhand in India, Chiang mai or Pai in Thailand would be my go too for fresh fruit and hiking and nice chill weather and atmosphere.

10800,Family of 6 onebagging Europe Right Now,"My wife and I plus 4 children (12-16) are making our way from Alaska through NY, France, Switzerland, and Italy right now- all carrying our stuff in <30L bags. I’m super happy everyone was on board because we really don’t have time for delays due to lost checked bags. I think the smallest is that colorful Cotopaxi bag and I’m really impressed by that thing. 

I was thinking about some extras that I brought that I second guessed as excessive, but have been useful so I wanted to pass it on…

1. 6’ USB A extension cable. It’s kind of heavy and I even considered throwing it away until my sons slept in a bunk bed in Paris and it was perfect for having his phone up on his bed. 
2. Moleskin and tiny folding scissor. This has been a foot saver for half of us on numerous trips. 
3. Repair kit with gear tape, sewing kit, zip ties…
It’s a total “what if” thing but also the kind of thing that when you need it you REALLY appreciate it. 
Today I sewed one of the backpack straps back onto my little packable daypack that started ripping off. 

So all of those things that aren’t necessarily super minimalist have proven their value for taking up a little room and weight.  

Another thing I’ll share as something that I think people should implement; kids not having their phones with them during the day on vacation. Normally they pull them out at any little lull in the action, and I just didn’t want to have that battle everyday. We’ve invested way too much money and planning into this trip to have them playing Clash of Clans waiting while in line at Versailles or sitting on the subway in NY. They have no idea how much they miss out on during those “boring” times staring at their phones. And that’s gone extremely well. They’re present and annoying, but they don’t seem to actively miss it and certainly don’t need it. 

I hope this is helpful or entertaining for someone!","deleted, I count bags! Come back to us when all of you are living out of one bag youll be crowned as the royal family!, I first read the title and half expected There are going to be people holding water bottles... ubersherpa hauling everything alone. OP, glad to see thats not the case. Looks like the start of many adventures, economical and flexible ones no less., Looks like freedom, That trip will give memories for the rest of yalls life. Love your phone idea, great solution to keep the kids engaged with their surroundings., You guys are rocking it right. I bought three backpacks for next trip to Istanbul and Taiwan. AER tp for me, mystery ranch ua, osprey daylite for my yo son. My yo daughter most probably will give up and ask others to carry her backpack so Ill skip her for the time being. My wife still hesitance on cutting the weight of her samsonite l luggage. but itll be a good start., Wow L. You just jumped in with both feet, eh? , That looks so much like Zurich but I cant quite place where the pics were taken and its bothering me. I gotta know. , Thats my city. Welcome to Zurich Switzerland, enjoy your trip. Good job on the backpacks for people. I got my family to go personal item only, but so far only for shorter trips., Im the only one bagger in my family and we are in EU rn too and Im sick of waiter for them in airport terminals in baggage claim lol., Hows the laundryaromatic situation with the whole fam I mean the teens? Also I mean is one person stuck with the laundry I am pretty sure that it would be me in my family. I am reluctant to embark on something like this, but it could be the best thing ever, How long is your trip? Are you changing accommodations every few days?, After college I travelled through Europe for a month with one backpack. Definitely doable. No cellphones back then so my friends will take turns carrying the heavy guidebooks lol, How are you doing this phone thing!?!?! I want details for my own implementation. Thanks!, Our family one bagged it for a London a few years ago...it was great! Well, not entirely. We went to London to meet up with our daughter who had just finished a semester abroad in Toledo, Spain. She had more luggage that the the three of us us and our son combined!, Excited to see the same REI trail that is also frequently my onebag. Great bag, Hello fellow poor decision maker! We just touched down in Europe with our family of , though, a younger age spread with our kids. We cheat a bit though. The kids are packed in L bags one each, but my wife and I each bring a domesticcarryon sized roller bag, and a small daypack. Weve found that like literally minutes ago with the little ones the roller bags serve doubleduty as both a dolly for their luggage, and impromptu stroller as were making our way through airports with jet lagged kids. It keeps us from going bagfeefree on discount carriers, but nearly all our flying is on points and miles, so weve never had an issue with domesticsized carryon allowances. Honestly, without oneishbagging I think international travel with a big family would be so much of a hassle we just wouldnt do it. And that would be terrible., removed, Thanks! Yeah its really the way to go and I hope the kids keep this in mind as they go through life., Funny! When I saw your comment I realized, yes my wife does carry a small purse but you cant see it in these pictures. Technicality! We will have to work on our one family, one bag."
14810,"I’ll be visiting Guangzhou for three weeks in December, my first time visiting China. Could use some help, please.","About me;

- 28 yr old male.

- Don’t know Mandarin or Cantonese, but trying my best to cram/learn as much 中文as possible before my trip. 

- Going to be staying with my S/O and in-laws around 白云区. 

- I like spas, clubs/bars, good food, video games, anime, technology, and open to exploring.

I’be been trying to search this sub for advice, but can’t seem to find much post-Covid information. I’d love suggestions on what to do, where to go, what to learn, etc. this trip will mostly be for my S/O to visit home and I will either be following my S/O around like a lost puppy, or I can try and start planning out what I can do on my own. Anything helps!","I like spas, clubsbars, good food, video games, anime, technology, and open to exploring. Just gonna add to the previous answers Baiyun is huge, so its hard to give you precise distance estimates. That said, for most of your list, Zhujiang New Town and Yuexiu will be kind of hubs food, clubs, bars, etc. There is a place called Comic City connected to metro lines and in Yuexiu, but Ive never been myself. I just see quite a lot of teenagers cosplaying to and from there on weekends especially. Baiyun itself has quite a lot of outdoors stuff to do, like hiking, bungee jumping, etc. There are many beautiful parks around the city that are worth visiting. The biggest question for these is the weather, so its complicated to give suggestions months ahead. One tourist point I have not seen mentioned yet is Beijing Road, which is basically a shoppingfood street area that is surrounded by historical landmarks. Technology sounds vague to me. What are you looking for on this one? Buying stuff? There are electronics markets all over the place, in Tianhe you can find a few different buildings around one called Guangzhou Computer Market line , Gangding station is closest. If youre looking for showrooms to see new stuff, Im not sure what besides the Canton Fair, but its held in April and November, so you will arrive after the second one is done. There are booths to show stuff at several shopping malls around the city, but I dont know how to find schedules for those. Without speaking Mandarin or Cantonese, expect to have some trouble getting around. Locals who can speak English are a minority, and often they get scared to death by the mere sight of a foreigner, so communication gets very hard. I recommend installing maps that work in China beforehand Apple Maps is decent and researching itineraries before leaving your place. If you dont want to take metro and bus both are excellent in Guangzhou, but during peak hours theyre both overcrowded, get DiDi, the Chinese Uber. Im not sure how payment works with it if you cant get a Chinese account linked, though. One good news is that since youre planning this with a lot of leeway, you can try to be ready for these gotchas and reduce issues. Getting a local SIM card with a lot of data and setting up payment on WeChat and Alipay should be some of the first things to do upon arrival. Theyll make your stay a lot less painful. Good luck! Edit Guangzhou also has quite a lot of historical spots to visit, one I like is Panyu Shawan Ancient Town. Panyu itself is similar to Baiyun in the sense that its a gigantic district that is basically its own city, so you can find lots of different stuff to do there. As a friend described Guangzhou to someone else. GZ is basically split into kinds of areas Tianhe is the modern downtown a bit too western for a lot of people districts like Baiyun and Panyu are basically their own cities inside of Guangzhou and districts like Yuexiu, Liwan and Haizhu are more traditional Guangzhou. Lastly, Foshan is also a very nice place to visit. Some people like Dongguan as well, but Ive never been. Ive heard its a mostly industrial place though., is one of the coolest speakeasies in China. Very creative cocktails by any standard and live jazz in the lounge area. Its not easy to find. The opening is a false pantry shelf in the back of a fake restaurant. Perfect for a date night. You will need a reservation in advance I havent been in years so it could be closed for all I know. It was founded and run by a Swiss guy and got so popular they opened up branches in other locations and cities Called Hope Sesame in English if Im not mistaken, Go to the top of GZ tower and do the bubble type cars at the top. Id wait until the sun is setting so you can see the city during daynight. Id also suggest hitting up Macao and HK since you are really close, spend days in both and at least feel the difference. Baiyun mountain has bungee jumping, Ive never been but Ive heard its pretty rad. Internet cafes require a Chinese ID so unless you plan on playing LoL or something with another, that might be out of the question. If you are into arcade games, Grandview mall has a massive arcade at the top floor and an ice skating rink too. Panyu has some amusementwater parks and zoos if you are into that and will be about an hour on the metro from Baiyun. I havent lived in GZ for about years but as far as I know, these places are still active, Hope that you are staying in the developed part of Baiyun. Baiyun is big, you could be a minute metro ride away from downtown or it could be minutes. If you like spas make sure you go experience Chinese hotsprings in one of the resorts in Conghua. Instead of going up the Canton tower I suggest you go to any of the top floor bars at Huacheng square Rosewood for example, have a fancy tea, and enjoy the view of the tower itself. Go biking along the Zhujiang river on an Alipay bike. The Trip app has a lot of information in English on what to do where to explore in their destinations section. Its just an English skin of one of the major Chinese platforms, so all the information is mostly up to date., Download and then just search for activities you like there. Just translate the keywords of your interest. For example I saw a few people with cosplay around Nanzhou station and in my area Jiangnanxi station there are a lot of internet cafe and other cafe with gaming consoles., Get dianping. Its an app. Super helpful. I have zero mandarin but shows you cool places around GZ. Comic city is cool but use the metro to see more interesting places like Nansha or Conghua. Sorry if spelling is wrong. Go to Canton Place or Party Pier for a drink or lunch. The Canton Tower rides are expensive. Check out Huacheng Square or Doushankou. A favorite is Factories for good western food The owner is American and really chill., Going to hijack this thread as I will be going to GZ next week ThursSat. Ive not been for years and wondering where are the good nightlife spots? I recall years ago there was an area called bar street but they are a bit too local for me disco type. Any reccomendations?, Dongshankou area has a lot of cool cafs and bars, for anime stuff and videogames you could go to Comic city located around the Gongyuanqian metro station. For food, SUSHIRO is a must! Its a japanese sushi chain.. not expensive, and authentic., I was just there for a couple weeks. What do you like to do? And what neighborhood in GZ are you staying in?, If you like exploring outside on hiking trails andor swimming in a mountain reservoir, Baiyun Shan White Cloud Mountain Park is a huge forest full of these things, and where the aforementioned bungee jumping is, in the southeast corner of the park nearest to the main entrance. There are many other entrances where you can avoid the crowds. FYI, if youre into bungee jumping, its common in Baiyun Shan for the staff to physically shove people off the platform once theyre hooked up., deleted, this will help you a lot if you want to search some place to go in GZ, and even in China. You can search things to eat and place to go here. And about the language, if you cannot learn enough Chinese before the time, you can try to find the youngsters, and ask your questions slowly , most of them will know what u r saying and try their best to help u. If not, you can go to the local police or volunteers, you dont have to be afraid of the police in China, we have an old saying is ask the police if you have a problem, that is to say the police will help. Volunteers are sought because many of them are students and their English is good. And hope you have a good time in GZ, if you have anything to ask , you can send me email cause i seldom on this app ... chiayioutlook.commailtochiayioutlook.com, Yes cool place in Dongshankou. One of the top bars in Asia. Check out Triple Rooster in the same area., I was there a couple weeks ago, the arcade in grand view is a lot smaller now it feels. But everything else is pretty much the same., Ive been seeing repeated mentions of Factories so see that it cant be missed!"

4352,London/Paris - Budget Travel Tips,"Looking for tips/suggestions for a 10 day trip to London/Paris next summer. I know it’s peak season n with Olympics around might be chaotic but hopefully can pull this off with a family of 4.

Appreciate anything you can share wrt -
1.budget hotel accommodations
2.transport(London to Paris and inter-city options)
3.attractions(must visit/free) & iterinaries u ve done in these cities.
4.Can I add another city if so which would make sense ?
5. We are foodies so would like to taste some must have items like fishNchips.

Fly into LHR N Return from CDG

This is what I ve got so far for London -

Budget hotels in London may be Travelodge or the hubs in Zone2/3, can’t do the hostels with family.

Use Tube for transport to/fro LHR & the city attractions - Contactless option

Food - Explore the various markets/Tesco meals 

What are my options in Paris for the above ?

Would buying guided tours for both cities make sense ?
 Any discounted ticket options that I can book ahead of time ?
 Is it recommended to carry some cash or just use a credit card through the trip ?

If there is a Wiki/links with this info please guide me and sorry for the repost.

Thanks in advance… Cheers !","Accommodation next to supermarket is key. In Paris, go to the next supermarket, buy a cheese thats cheap for daily offer together with a nice baguette. Croissants for kids if they like. Even in the supermarkets those things taste a lot more originalbetter then in your home country wherever that is, You can get guided tours but I personally would prefer to do it all myselfall part of the discovery of visiting both L and P, especially if youre on a budget. I wouldnt bother with cash in either of these cities, apart from if you want takeaway fish and chipsmost want cash only. For London fish n chips, try Brockley Rock, SE or Poppies E or more centrally Gigs, W, just off Tottenham Court Road. In Paris, hit up the Latin Quarter for cheap Middle East cuisinethink kebabs and also Moroccan merguez sausages etc. Check out the fixed menus called La formule or le menu which are usually great value. Also the Bouillons are cheap and fun, the most celebrated being Chartier, a beautiful building and cheap and reasonable food. Youll love the old world feel to the place. Join the queue, which moves quickly. They rely on quick throughput to keep prices down. Put bouillon and Chartier into google to see what youre in for. days is perfect to do London and Paris, days in each. You really wont have time for anywhere else tbh. Museums are mostly free in London, not in Paris. However some are free on certain days of the week or st Sunday of the monthbook any free days online in advance.Le Petit Palais fine art or Carnavalet history of Paris are stunning and free! Enjoy!, There are free Paris walking tours by locals for tip only. There is a cheap bus tofrom CDG from city central., Pick up the Rick Steves travel guides for London and Paris. Hes good at identifying independently owned budgetfriendly lodging and reasonably priced dining options. Hes also good at laying out the top sites to see depending on how much time you have. The books often include selfguided tours of top museums and sites. For lodging you might also look into renting an apartment assuming youre splitting your time evenly between the two cities. This gives you a kitchen great for cooking breakfast and the occasional lunch or dinner, more room to spread out, and may give you the ability to do laundry. Ive done this in both cities with my family. There is plenty to see in and around Paris and London, that I wouldnt try to add another destination. Have fun!, If your stay in London is before July, UKs Hotel Chain Point A is running a ChristmasBoxing Day Sale until the end of January for stays until June th, . Besides Travelodge and Premier Inn, Point A is another chain worth considering. If you are staying near Paddington Train Station or leaving from that area you can book the Heathrow Express, which costs about the same as The Tube if you book early five months for me and takes less than half of the time. Most museums around the UK are free, which includes London. For entertainment, The Globe Theatre offers standing tickets for pounds and you can find some really fun plays. For transport between London and Paris, look at the Eurostar prices. The train takes you to the city centre you can walk to Sacre Couer and Montmartre from Gare Du Nord. If you flight into the CDG airport, the train, bus or taxi will add a lot of money for though I understand there is a cheaper bus. Both cities should have free tours you can tip whatever you want, at the end., There are good free or very cheap especially if using it for multiple people podcast or internet tour guides, if you research ahead of time that can save you quite a bit. Look into ones that are sold in the range of but also look for museum or city offerings., Thanks i do not see a family room option though on their site. I will have to book rooms which again adds up. Are their any similar budget hotel options in Paris, just cant find anything, might have to look into AirBnBs., Have you tried the ACCOR website? Ibis, Ibis Styles, Novotel and sometimes Mercure are usually budget brands. They offer a lot of options around the city., Thanks.. will check them out."
5541,Major passport issue,"Hey everybody, my fiancé and I are in one of the most bizarre travel situations of our lives and are hoping to see if anyone has ever dealt with this and/or might have advice on what to do!

Our original flight was from Boston to Detroit (3/4) with a final destination of Tokyo. We entered our passport info into the delta website and checked in, had the boarding passes in had. Due to weather in Boston we had to change our itinerary and fly through Atlanta.

Here is where everything gets a bit weird. I go to check us in but am being blocked with a message that we now need to check in at the airport - no biggie, happens from time to time. We show up and learn that our passports were reported stolen?!?! Delta could not check us in as our passports (that were in hand, along with other ID info) are of course no longer valid.

WTF! Our only option was to change the flight again to depart 3/7 evening with the hopes of getting an appointment tomorrow and a same day passport, which seems bleak.

Has anyone ever heard of something like this? Any advise?

Edit - Update! 

Thank you all for the responses and help here. Turns out that my fiancé's passport had been reported lost in May of 2019. We don't who did this, but remember that it had been misplaced during this time period and suspect a family member might have done this on her behalf. Since Covid happened shortly after this, she had no use for the passport and had no idea it was no longer valid. 

My passport on the other hand was completely fine to travel. Delta's system would not let me check in however until my fiancé's passport was valid. 

We were able to get a passport appointment/issued a new passport on Tuesday the 7th, just in time for our flight to Japan at 8pm that day!","If you are aware of, or have been a victim of, fraud associated with a U.S. passport or U.S. visa application, please contact PassportVisaFraudstate.gov., You might want to contact your local US Representative as they can sometimes pull strings on passport issues., deleted, Everything everyone else said, but it sounds really really suspicious to me. I would ask, like the other poster, is there anyone in your lives that might want to sabotage your trip? Anyone who has your record locator can call and make changes. Seems like the system would be more secure, but thats the way it works. I had a friend who was going on a group trip, but booked her own flights.

Be persistent that the error is on their end and that they are not lost or stolen nor have they been reported to the relevant authorities as such,if you can confirm thats the case. They should be able to provide a reference number or something, the airline cant simply decide with no basis that theyre loststolen., Ive had a slightly similar issue related to a passport I reported stolen or lost decades ago.

I cant remember the cost but they let you pay in installments. The package included hotels, airport transfers, trains from city to city.

They are good about helping through hiccups with hotels. Expedia also can get you good rooms but if theres any problem, the hotel is limited in how they can make it right and Expedia is no help.

Their prices are pretty competitive, but their hotel selections can be limited and currently, their website does not have an option to select premium economy airfare only economy, business, and first class. This is especially important for the international flights. They only way to get a premium economy class is to call Costco travel and get a quote. The last time I did a price comparison for the flight to LHR on premium eco class, purchasing directly from American Airlines was less expensive. Another thing I noticed is that depending on the agent, you get a different quote, and they are not a travel agent so pretty limited in their knowledge., Used costco travel for our Vancouver trip from Toronto.

5707,Going to Europe for 2 Months (May/June). Any specific city/region recommendations other than the main tourist attractions? Looking for hidden gem,Edit: You all are amazing… now I dont think 2months is enough to experience all the amazing places mentioned below. Time to re-budget and add an additional month I think. Haha,"If you happen upon the Czech Republic, esk Krumlov is about a thirty minute train ride. Its a medieval village complete with castle, cobblestones, labyrinthine walls, with winding river around it. Its breathtaking., Gimmelwald Switzerland is magical!, Malta is beautiful, Lake Bled in Slovenia! Or Madeira Island!, The Dolomites in northern Italy. Alpes de suisi in particular., Pula or nearby Rovinj in northern Croatia. The more Popular destinations of Dubrovnik Split are fantastic, but if you want that smaller hidden gem feel, I love Pula. Amphitheatre there is amazing, Rovinj is very picturesque you can get a bus between Pula and Rovinj, and you can get a boat over to Brijuni island which is a very nice national park., The Valis is Switzerland is fantastic. Bayerischer Wald in Germany is like going back in time To me its mostly about experiences, there use to be a brewery in the hills above Salzburg run by monks. Also the Ice Caves near Salzburg is well worth a trip. Peel away your insecurities with a vusit to one of the many Wellness spas in any German or Dutch speaking country., Budapest is a great go to for an affordable good time, Slovenia Ljubljana, Bovec and soca valley, Piran., Its so wide and varied that it truly depends what you wanna do. I love the beach so Athens for culture then onwards on the ferry to Kefalonia, Crete and the major isles. For shopping Paris or Frankfurt. For polish pottery Boleslaweic in Poland and cool beer baths Pilsen where the beer is brewed. For chic and showtunes London with an escape to Stonehenge. Croatia is good for beach partying.

Without knowing these, I will share some of my discoveries and gems that bear in mind a moderate budget which leaves out many of my favorites in westernnorthern Europe . Central Europe Krakow, Prague, CzeskyKrumlov, Vienna expensive, Bratislava maybe, Budapest...then add Transylvania, particularly the Saxon towns . Southern IberiaMorocco southern Portugal Lisbon to Faro and Spain Seville and Granada and then fly or ferry to Morocco you can train most of the country I loved Fez but didnt care for Casablanca . Northern Italy often you can get good rates flying into Bologna which I love and Milan which I dont. I spent a month just taking the train and exploring the northern half of Italy and loved it.
