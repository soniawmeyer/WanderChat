","An answer is somewhat contingent on the weather where youll be hiking at. If you can keep food refrigerator cold, your options are limited by your skills as a chef. For camping trips where Im near a car and have limited weight constraints, Ive brought a cast iron and cooked ribeyes, baked potatos in foil near coals, and vegetables. Another easy one is marinating flankskirt steak and making fajitas. You can toast tortillas on a fire and easily dice up an onionbpjalapeo. Breakfast can be eggs, bacon, and fruit... Or you could make pancakes. That being said, for an actual backpacking trip, I always bring Peak freeze dried meals and dessert, which taste nothing like the stereotypical freeze dried food. If you havent actually tried this specific brand, Id recommend getting one and preparing it at home. Your buddy may like this. Also, if yall are drinkers, bring a Nalgene with some nice whiskey and a cigar., Andrew Skurka has some great recipes for backpacking. His beans and rice with cheese and Fritos is one of my standbys I add some precooked hamburger or chicken if temperatures allow. You can freeze raw meat, wrap it in foil and bury it deep in your pack for the first night. Some people do steak but I can never really get it cooked right and steak is kind of bland anyway. I prefer a good sausage and instant mash. Like a sausage designed for braising. Thai packs well. You can get powdered coconut milk at most Asian markets. Peanut butter packets from Justins. Soy from wherever. There are plenty of green curry powders or pad Thai packs. Veggies and dehydrated tofu my coop carries this in bulk with either rice noodles cold soaked or instant jasmine rice. That said, I eat Peak freeze dried meals a lot., Soup is awesome. Put all the ingredients for it in a bag, bring a baguette. At camp, all you have to do is boil water and add your bag o goodies minutes later, voila, soup and baguette. Easy to make, comforting and filling to eat.

Based on the shared insights and considering you’re okay with carrying about 10 pounds of food, I’d suggest kicking things off with a classic—cast iron ribeyes. Season them to your liking before you head out, vacuum seal them if possible, and they’ll be ready to go over the fire with minimal effort for that first-night feast. Pair it with foil-wrapped baked potatoes and some hearty vegetables charred over the coals.

For a dish that's both a culinary adventure and practical for backpacking, I’m quite taken with the idea of making fajitas. Marinate flanks or skirt steak in a flavorful blend, and with just a pan, you can cook the meat and toast tortillas over the fire. Throw in some freshly diced onions and jalapeños for that fresh crunch.

Breakfast could be a lavish affair too; imagine starting the day with some fluffy pancakes or a spread of eggs and bacon, paired with fruit to keep things balanced.

As your trip continues, to keep things simple yet sumptuous, consider those gourmet freeze-dried meals like Peak’s. They’re not your average freeze-dried fare and can be quite delicious. Plus, they won’t weigh you down as much.

And for that touch of indulgence, nothing beats a fine whiskey shared by the campfire. It warms you up and pairs wonderfully with the quiet of the woods—luxury in its purest form.

If the weather’s on the cooler side, you might want to pack a DIY cowboy stew kit. Assemble ingredients for a beef or lamb stew with vegetables in a tin foil packet. Let it cook in the fire’s embers while you and your buddy recount the day's trek. It's a satisfying end to an active day.

Remember, the key is in the preparation. Do as much as you can at home so you can enjoy the camping experience to the fullest without being tied to the camp kitchen. Bon appétit and happy trails!

53,"this is the question:
",2 week solo trip in Latin America - where to go?,"Hey fellow travelers! I'm absolutely passionate about exploring new countries, and this time, I'm considering venturing solo in January/February in Latin America. I'll be in Colombia with my boyfriend in February, visiting his family, but before that, I want to do a solo adventure for 1 to 2 weeks.

I've traveled solo before in Southeast Asia. In Latin America I've been to Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama (and Colombia) before, but always with a companion. This time, I want to discover a brand-new country.

My interests revolve around nature, wildlife, hiking, and getting to know different cultures. I'm particularly keen on visiting national parks, beaches, and if possible even spotting whales and turtles.

I'm seeking recommendations from other travelers who've explored Latin America. Where should I head that's not only perfect for a 1 to 2 week route but also safe for a solo woman like me? I'd greatly appreciate your insights, advice, and personal stories!","these are the comments:
","How about Ecuador? Hiking Cotopaxi, Quilatoa, wildlife Isla de la Plata or Galapagos if you have the budget, beaches Montanita and nearby, the Amazon jungle, and other nice nature places like Banos and Mindo. I did most of that by myself as a solo female and felt very safe though you have to use Latin America city common sense in Quito., Hey so as other people are mentioning Ecuador. I went last year and felt so safe. Safer than say Peru. However, I would avoid Guayaquil, Ecuador. Guayaquil is being hit very hard by street crime and cartel related fights. I went to Quito Baos was planning my next trip last year and I also read that Guayaquil doesnt have that much to see so youre not missing anything there., Peru is the best South American country., Ecuador is awesome and I agree with all your recommendations except would avoid montanita its become a shithole recently full of junkies and passport bros, Thanks for the tips! Which month did you travel there? And how are the distances between the places?, Cuenca was cool. Canoa as well, Agree on avoiding montanita. The rest of ecuador is beautiful but the beaches feel unsafe and are not beautiful, The distances are not that far thats why it would be a great trip for just one or two weeks. Everything is just a night Bus away from each other. Ecuador would also be my suggestion. Small and really diverse., I was there in April and May. Things are fairly close. The Amazon trip was a long bus ride each way from Quito I did night bus and day bus but worth it. I did go to the Montanita area through a short flight from Quito to Guayaquil though and then a bus. I see other people hating on Montanita, and its definitely a party town, but I didnt feel unsafe and thought the beach was ok personally. But there are other smaller recommended towns, especially for surfing, in that area but I just dont know their names off the top of my head because I didnt go.",respond to the question as if you're being asked directly given the comments as context,"this is the question:

2 week solo trip in Latin America - where to go?Hey fellow travelers! I'm absolutely passionate about exploring new countries, and this time, I'm considering venturing solo in January/February in Latin America. I'll be in Colombia with my boyfriend in February, visiting his family, but before that, I want to do a solo adventure for 1 to 2 weeks.

I've traveled solo before in Southeast Asia. In Latin America I've been to Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama (and Colombia) before, but always with a companion. This time, I want to discover a brand-new country.

My interests revolve around nature, wildlife, hiking, and getting to know different cultures. I'm particularly keen on visiting national parks, beaches, and if possible even spotting whales and turtles.

I'm seeking recommendations from other travelers who've explored Latin America. Where should I head that's not only perfect for a 1 to 2 week route but also safe for a solo woman like me? I'd greatly appreciate your insights, advice, and personal stories!these are the comments:

Given your passion for nature, wildlife, and culture, I'd recommend considering Ecuador for your 1 to 2-week solo trip. It's a country rich in biodiversity and cultural experiences, and many solo female travelers have found it welcoming and safe, with the right precautions.

In Ecuador, you can hike the majestic Cotopaxi and explore the Quilatoa Loop, which offers stunning vistas of the crater lake. For wildlife and marine life, the unique ecosystem of the Galápagos Islands is unparalleled—though it's more on the pricey side. If you're interested in whale watching, the best time would be between June and September when humpback whales visit the coast, but January and February still offer rich wildlife encounters, especially on Isla de la Plata, known as the 'poor man's Galápagos.'

You can also soak up the sun on the beaches of Montañita—though it has recently gained a reputation for being less appealing due to an influx of party tourism and associated troubles. It might still be worth a visit, or you could explore other nearby coastal towns that are recommended for their surfing and calmer ambiance.

For a touch of the Amazon, you can venture into the jungle, experiencing the rich biodiversity and connecting with indigenous communities. Baños and Mindo offer lush landscapes with plenty of outdoor activities, like zip-lining and bird-watching, in a more relaxed environment.

Ecuador's size makes it ideal for a short trip, as most destinations are just a night bus away from each other, allowing you to experience the Andes, Amazon, and coast all within your timeframe.

Do consider Cuenca for its cultural heritage and charm if you want to immerse yourself in Ecuador's history. While there, I would suggest steering clear of Guayaquil due to recent concerns about safety.

Travel within Ecuador is relatively straightforward, and many journeys can be done overnight, making efficient use of your time. April and May are beautiful months to visit, but January and February still offer good weather, fewer tourists, and the opportunity to see the country in full bloom.

Remember to bring layers for the varied altitudes and climates and always stay aware of your surroundings. Ecuador's diversity, from its landscapes to its wildlife and its people, can offer a fulfilling and safe solo travel experience.

If you're planning an 8-day tour in Istanbul, consider a few key aspects like group size, itinerary, inclusivity of meals, and cost to find the best value for your money.

Intrepid Travel is known for small group sizes, which can provide a more personal and immersive experience. They often focus on sustainable and responsible travel, so if these are important factors for you, Intrepid could be the right choice. Their tours typically offer a balance between organized activities and free time, allowing you to explore on your own as well.

Travel Talk, on the other hand, is often appreciated for its affordability and social aspects, often attracting a younger crowd. Including some dinners can be a convenient way to sample local cuisine if you prefer not to worry about finding places to eat after a long day of sightseeing. However, exploring local eateries on your own is also a fantastic way to get to know the city and its culture, so if your schedule allows, it might be worthwhile to have a few meals independently.

In Istanbul, you'll find a wealth of culinary delights, and eating out can be as much a part of the travel experience as visiting historical sites. Depending on where you are in the city, you could have dinner overlooking the Bosphorus or in a cozy restaurant in one of the city's historic neighborhoods.

Before deciding, I recommend checking recent reviews and testimonials for both companies, focusing on tours of Turkey to get the most relevant insights. Consider reaching out to the companies directly to ask about the specifics of their June itineraries, such as exact group sizes and which meals are included. This way, you can ensure the tour aligns with your preferences for both the social and culinary aspects of your trip.

Whether you opt for the convenience of included meals or the adventure of discovering local food spots, Turkey's rich culture and cuisine are sure to make your trip memorable.

Given the National Parks' restrictions on where dogs can go, you're right to look for dog-friendly areas and consider how long your furry friend can travel without needing a break.

For your route, it looks like you've got a great mix of stunning natural wonders and city experiences. In Monument Valley, Bryce, Grand Canyon, and Sedona, you'll find some trails or areas that allow dogs, but you'll need to keep your dog leashed and stick to areas that are pet-friendly. For the Grand Canyon specifically, pets are only allowed on trails above the rim.

When you’re in places like Phoenix, White Sand Dunes, and Carlsbad Caverns, you'll want to check each park's regulations. For instance, dogs are not allowed in the Carlsbad Caverns but are allowed in some parts of White Sands National Monument.

For the longer drives, it's critical to give your dog regular breaks to stretch, exercise, and relieve themselves. Bringfido.com is an excellent resource for finding dog parks along your route, and the I Overlander app can help locate public lands near National Parks for dog-friendly trails.

In terms of meals, Goldee’s BBQ sounds like a fantastic choice in Fort Worth. When considering whether to dine out or have meals included, remember that flexibility can be valuable when traveling with a pet. Eating out may depend on finding dog-friendly restaurants, whereas having meals provided could simplify your planning.

Remember that road trips can be as much about the journey as the destination. Consider the advice of fellow travelers who suggest taking it slower to truly enjoy each spot and give your dog ample leisure time. Splitting those long driving days into shorter increments can make the trip more enjoyable for both of you.

",Planning a family road trip from Vancouver to Quebec then Nova Scotia while our teens still like us - advice on route?,"Our family is planning a 3-4 week trip to visit family in Quebec and Nova Scotia *this summer. After looking at the logistics of flights, car rentals, dog sitter at home, etc, we are weighing the other option of driving, amd making a road trip out of it. 

Both of our kids are keen (14 and 16) and we feel like we may only have one more shot at an epic cross Canada adventure before they are launched.

We are considering going through the US (I90) on the way there, and coming home the Canada route. This way we can check out some sites in Montana like Yellowstone.  Also, gas, motels, food etc seem to still be a bit cheaper. 

We would have out camping stuff with is, but aim to stay in hotels at least 50% of the time. From Quebec to Halifax we are with friends and family.

Any advice on things to consider or check out? If we drive, we‚Äôll take 4 weeks. 

Thanks all,","these are the comments:
","If it works in your schedule, I would recommend Bic National Park Parc national du Bic just west of Rimouski. Its gorgeous but also very small so you wont feel like youre missing out with a short stay. Campground reservations at SEPAQ for next summer just opened this week so you still might have a chance to get a spot. Also, you mentioned in a comment youll be travelling late July and early August. Be aware that most people in Quebec take their vacation during construction holidays, which will be from July st to August rd next summer. I would strongly advise to avoid these dates to do anything remotely touristic in Quebec during that time as everything will be booked and packed with people. I would also recommend stopping by the great lakes for camping. If you leave the US from Detroit, maybe a quick stop to Point Pelee National Park so you can see the southernmost point of continental Canada and then camp at Long Point Provincial Park. The campgrounds are right next to white sandy beaches and bright blue lakes, it feels like youre by the sea., Thats a long trip for teenagers! There would be plenty to see on I, but also lots and lots of stretches of nothing. Same on the way back in Canada after Alberta. I am assuming this is planned for the summer when the kids are not attending school. Thats also going to be when it will be tough to get campgrounds and cheaper hotels. I would say it might be better to do separate trips QuebecNova Scotia and then the PNW and all the Canadian NPs around Banff on another trip., Is gas really cheaper in the USA? its .g in Chicago, so .USL say, which would be .CDN, right? check my maths. The exchange rate is a bummer.

Planning a family road trip from Vancouver to Quebec then Nova Scotia while our teens still like us - advice on route?Our family is planning a 3-4 week trip to visit family in Quebec and Nova Scotia *this summer. After looking at the logistics of flights, car rentals, dog sitter at home, etc, we are weighing the other option of driving, amd making a road trip out of it. 

Both of our kids are keen (14 and 16) and we feel like we may only have one more shot at an epic cross Canada adventure before they are launched.

We are considering going through the US (I90) on the way there, and coming home the Canada route. This way we can check out some sites in Montana like Yellowstone.  Also, gas, motels, food etc seem to still be a bit cheaper. 

We would have out camping stuff with is, but aim to stay in hotels at least 50% of the time. From Quebec to Halifax we are with friends and family.

Any advice on things to consider or check out? If we drive, we‚Äôll take 4 weeks. 

Thanks all,these are the comments:
If it works in your schedule, I would recommend Bic National Park Parc national du Bic just west of Rimouski. Its gorgeous but also very small so you wont feel like youre missing out with a short stay. Campground reservations at SEPAQ for next summer just opened this week so you still might have a chance to get a spot. Also, you mentioned in a comment youll be travelling late July and early August. Be aware that most people in Quebec take their vacation during construction holidays, which will be from July st to August rd next summer. I would strongly advise to avoid these dates to do anything remotely touristic in Quebec during that time as everything will be booked and packed with people. I would also recommend stopping by the great lakes for camping. If you leave the US from Detroit, maybe a quick stop to Point Pelee National Park so you can see the southernmost point of continental Canada and then camp at Long Point Provincial Park. The campgrounds are right next to white sandy beaches and bright blue lakes, it feels like youre by the sea., Thats a long trip for teenagers! There would be plenty to see on I, but also lots and lots of stretches of nothing. Same on the way back in Canada after Alberta. I am assuming this is planned for the summer when the kids are not attending school. Thats also going to be when it will be tough to get campgrounds and cheaper hotels. I would say it might be better to do separate trips QuebecNova Scotia and then the PNW and all the Canadian NPs around Banff on another trip., Is gas really cheaper in the USA? its .g in Chicago, so .USL say, which would be .CDN, right? check my maths.

Given that you’re planning for a 3-4 week trip, you have a fantastic window to explore and enjoy a variety of sights without feeling too rushed.

Considering the tips and personal experiences shared, here are some suggestions:

**Route Planning:**
- Include some natural wonders like Bic National Park near Rimouski for a short and enriching stop.
- Avoid traveling during Quebec’s construction holiday (late July to early August) to steer clear of the crowds.
- For a unique experience, consider adding Great Sand Dunes and Black Canyon of the Gunnison in the US to your trip.

**Accommodation:**
- Mixing camping with hotel stays is smart, especially with your aim of hotels 50% of the time. This will offer a blend of adventure and comfort.
- KOA campgrounds can be a cost-effective option with the added bonus of various activities, which can be great for teens.

**Timing:**
- Start planning soon, as campgrounds and affordable accommodations book up quickly, especially in peak seasons.
- Splitting your trip between natural parks and urban attractions can offer diversity without overwhelming anyone with long driving stretches.

**Activities:**
- Consider rodeo events as a unique cultural experience, particularly in the Midwest if you decide to go through the US.
- Amateur radio is a unique suggestion, providing an educational and engaging activity during long drives. It can also be a practical tool for communication.

**Dining:**
- Try to balance eating out and self-catering to experience both local flavors and familiar comforts. It’s also a chance for the family to bond over meal preparations.

**Safety and Comfort:**
- Ensure your vehicle is well-equipped for the journey, with comfort items, emergency kits, and entertainment options.
- Plan for regular breaks and stay flexible with your itinerary to accommodate spontaneous explorations or rest.

Most importantly, involve your teenagers in the planning process. Their buy-in will make the trip more enjoyable for everyone. It’s an opportunity to explore new areas, learn together, and grow as a family.

From the comments, it sounds like Yedidia in the Baqa neighborhood is a great place to start.

Yedidia is indeed a synagogue, and Baqa (sometimes spelled Baka) is not a separate city but a neighborhood within Jerusalem, located next to Talpiot.

",Cross border car rental suggestions 3-4 days trip,"Hello everyone

I am a Canadian and planning to drive from Budapest to Vienna, Prague (maybe not that close) and then back to Budapest. We are 3 people

I am spending most time in Budapest and Italy this time but I want to do like a short road trip like driving around for a change, to cities closer to Budapest.

I looked at Autoeurope and did a search and found this dryyve website , Suzuki viatara Automatic, they're charging \\~160 EUROS(with lazy pack)  with unlimited mileage, additional drivers + one time cross border 99EUROS fees. I don't know if there can be any other hidden costs or any other company which can be better than this overall?

Thanks in advance!","these are the comments:
","You sound like a masochist. Why not take a train or fly? It will be much cheaper using a car in Budapest, Vienna, and Prague is not practical at all. Parking its self is extremely difficult and public transit is king downtown. For cross border, maybe Sixt if you insist. Edit Try Europcar as well maybe., I knew that North Americans have a different perception of distance than us, but did you really call Budapest Vienna Prague Munich a short road trip?, the hidden costs are if you choose the wrong rental company. they will scrutinize the auto for damage of any amount and charge you for it. do proper research on a travelers forum rather than a city sub. but i agree with others that this road trip idea is foolish considering you are planning to do it this month where there is a possibility of extreme winter weather and a certainty of short days., I have done Budapest, Vienna and Prague on days and it was really short.. The train is nice. Dont think there trio will be better for a road trip to be honest, I dont see why they would charge you extra for crossing the border, looks like a scam. You can freely travel inside the EU, and insurances cover EU wide by default. Im traveling cross border frequently with rental and havent had to pay anything extra once. Id use a larger one like Avis, Hertz, or Sixt, where policies are created and enforced by the owning branches. You can try and ask rcartalkhungary theyre a quite nice bunch of guys, although Im not sure if theyre familiar with rental. Also, as others said, train connections and schedules are quite good if youre willing to sacrifice some comfort. Inside larger cities, youll need to travel by public transport anyway if youre planning on preserving your sanity., I have an even better idea. You could do Canada, US and Mexico in three days. Its only countries but you will equally see nothing and you get to save on the plane ticket., I always use sunnycars, they also insure everything even if the local car dealer makes you pay something, youll get reimbursed via them. Its like a booking.com for car rentals. Youll still end up getting your car via Europcar and such, Id say pick cities that are somewhat close to each other BP and Prague, BP and Vienna, Vienna and Prague, Munich and Vienna, Munich and Prague and spend days in one of them, then take the train takes a few hours, which is much better than the hassle of renting a car and driving to the other city, and spend days there, then fly home. I know its tempting to visit as many places as possible, but the things that will happen to you if you stick to your plan will probably be these . You will spend a big chunk of your time on a highway, where theres nothing to see except for gas stations and the occasional wind turbine. . In the remaining time, you will barely have enough time to really experience each city you will probably rush to the city centre, where youll see the same baroqueart noveaugothic buildings, eat similar food and drink similar drinks. These cities are all in Germaninfluenced Central Europe, to a foreigner they are not that different from each other if you look superficially not even for me, a local tbh. Like imagine you have half a day in Calgary, Vancouver, Seattle and Portland each. What will you see? If you really want to explore the things that are worth exploring in each city, you need at least a day or two for that. . If you dont have experience driving in Europe, you will probably be stressed. VERY stressed. This is not North America where roads are wide, parking spaces many and cities are designed for driving. Imagine trying to parallel park on a street thats like steps wide because it was designed in for drving oxen, while scooters are buzzing around you and cyclists can appear out of nowhere, any time. And then when you get back to your car, you see that you have a flat tire happened to me, and your whole trips ruined. So just do yourself a favor pick two cities, spend days in one, walk around instead of driving, explore the the interesting layers under the surface, then hop on a train, sit down in the dining car, have a beer, take a nap in your seat, wake up in city number and start over, then fly home., Thanks for the hint. I will check that one. What do you think of klasswagen abd Dryyve an feedback?, Haha , not Munich , its too much. But Budapest as starting point Vienna stay Prague stay Bratislavastay back to Budapest. That seems doable to me and we are drivers., Thanks for pointing it out. I will post in other forum., I am spending most time in Budapest and Italy this time but wanted to do like a short road trip like driving around for a change to cities closer to Budapest. But plan to do other European countries with sufficient time on next trip. But I will consider what you suggested. Thanks for the feedback, Thanks for pointing out the main companies. Just out of curiosity I checked for Hertz , cross border policy, they also have some charges as well under cross border policy, idk why its like that..... Vehicles may be driven into Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy excluding Sicily, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. An additional fee of . including tax per rental applies if you wish to drive abroad., I know what you mean and I am aware of it. I am only doing specific cities just for a change, the city vibes and a road trip. The long trip plan, maybe next time...., Thank so much for detailed explanation. I am now reconsidering this driving plan. But in the entire plan I was actually planning to do cities only i.e Prague and Vienna, spending like . day each. BP is just a pick up and drop off point. For the driving experience, no I dont have but youre it can be stressful then. Ok may I ask if I want to drive around closer to Budapest, which city would it be for a wonderful road trip experience? Last thing, you mentioned that one can drive and then return the car in other foreign country, correct? Ill check that too., Never heard of either., Yeah, it is doable, but you will be sitting in your car for at least hours, which is an entire day out of the . You wont have the time to properly explore either of the mentioned cities in such short time. Your entire vacation would feel like you are rushing from city to city., Im not sure. Maybe its a surcharge to cover communication and documentation costs in case something happens? I looked it up now. Its the same for me, but I had no idea its in place., Well if you really insist on driving and you want to include Budapest, Id have the following suggestions for a road trip Start in Vienna, spend a day there, then drive south to Lake Balaton, then along by the lake. Its a big lake and its north shore is pretty nice, there are places to stop at like Keszthely which has a nice castle and a thermal lake, theres the Kli basin, vineyards, Balatonfred, Veszprm, Szkesfehrvr, the old coronation city etc., then you can take highway number to Budapest, spend a day there too, then drive back to Vienna on the highway, it takes , hours from downtown Budapest to Schwechat airport if theres no traffic. Or you can drive from Budapest to Prague via Vienna but then you probably dont want to drive back, as thats like hours of driving, so youd have to drop off the car in Prague. Mind you, this is also easier to do by train. Or you can start in Vienna and drive to Prague via Cesky Krumlov, Ceske Budejovice or Pilsen, that might be worth the drive as well. Yes, you can drop your car off in a different country, but that aint cheap. Ive just checked and if you rent even a small car in Budapest and you drop it off in Prague, it will cost you at least CAD a day, and thats without gas, road tolls or parking fees., And how about just doing cities Prague and Vienna ? Hows that sound?",respond to the question as if you're being asked directly given the comments as context,"this is the question:

Cross border car rental suggestions 3-4 days tripHello everyone

I am a Canadian and planning to drive from Budapest to Vienna, Prague (maybe not that close) and then back to Budapest. We are 3 people

I am spending most time in Budapest and Italy this time but I want to do like a short road trip like driving around for a change, to cities closer to Budapest.

I looked at Autoeurope and did a search and found this dryyve website , Suzuki viatara Automatic, they're charging \\~160 EUROS(with lazy pack)  with unlimited mileage, additional drivers + one time cross border 99EUROS fees. I don't know if there can be any other hidden costs or any other company which can be better than this overall?

Thanks in advance!these are the comments:

Hows that sound?respond to the question as if you're being asked directly given the comments as context","When planning a road trip from Budapest to Vienna and possibly Prague, there are several factors to consider to make sure your trip is both enjoyable and practical, especially if you're intending to drive across borders.

**Car Rental:**
- The deal you found with Autoeurope seems reasonable, but ensure you read the fine print regarding cross-border fees and additional drivers. It's also worth comparing with other rental companies like Sixt, Europcar, or local options such as klasswagen and Dryyve for feedback on service and pricing.
- Check the insurance policy to make sure it covers all the countries you plan to visit.
- Be aware of the potential for hidden costs like charges for damages, which can occur with less reputable rental agencies. Thoroughly document the car's condition before and after the rental period to avoid disputes.
- For cross-border fees, these can sometimes apply due to additional insurance or administrative costs for the rental company. Always confirm the total cost upfront.

**Road Trip Experience:**
- The cities you've chosen are relatively close to each other and are connected by good roads, making for a doable short road trip. However, consider the advice of others suggesting you may miss out on truly experiencing the cities if you're rushing from one to another.
- Aim to spend at least 1.5 to 2 days in each major city to soak in the atmosphere and not feel rushed.
- While driving in Europe, especially through city centers, can be more stressful than in North America, it can also be an adventure. Ensure you're comfortable with the vehicle and the traffic rules.
- Factor in parking challenges and the convenience of public transportation when visiting city centers.

**Alternative Travel Modes:**
- Many commenters have suggested that trains might be a better option for city-to-city travel in Europe, considering the ease of travel and the central locations of train stations.
- For a more relaxed pace, consider a scenic train ride. It can offer comfort and views while allowing everyone in the family to relax and not worry about navigating or parking.

**Sightseeing and Stops:**
- When selecting your cities, remember that places like Prague and Vienna offer rich cultural experiences that deserve ample time to explore.
- If you're looking to add unique stops to your road trip, research local attractions along the way or consider staying overnight in smaller towns or scenic areas.

In summary, a road trip can be a great way to see the countryside and have flexible travel plans, but make sure to balance driving time with exploring time. It's also worth considering alternate forms of transportation if they offer a more relaxed travel experience, especially during peak travel seasons.","When planning a road trip from Budapest to Vienna and possibly Prague, there are several factors to consider to make sure your trip is both enjoyable and practical, especially if you're intending to drive across borders.

",Travel tips no one asked for - Seoul vs. Tokyo,"People compare Seoul and Tokyo a lot. Here‚Äôs my round up of what‚Äôs better and worse for each‚Ä¶

COST: Seoul. It‚Äôs not very expensive. you can get a decent hotel for like $30-50usd a night. public transit, food, alcohol are all pretty cheap. Tokyo gets pricey fast by comparison. 

PUBLIC TRANSIT: Seoul, by a slight margin. The metro system is amazing and easy to navigate. The busses are great too. Tokyo‚Äôs is remarkable and fascinating but can be very very confusing if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese.

WEATHER: Tokyo. Winter is prohibitively cold in Seoul.

FOOD: Tokyo. Not even really comparable IMO. Food in Seoul is good, food in Tokyo is better than anywhere else on Earth.

FOREIGNER FRIENDLY: Seoul. Everything is bilingual English/Korean in terms of signage, menus etc. Neither city has a high level of English proficiency but Seoul‚Äôs is marginally better.

PEOPLE: Tokyo. Japanese people are unimaginably welcoming and Tokyo feels absurdly safe. Korean people are more distant (to foreigners) and at nighttime there are too many drunk people around, it can feel sketchy. 

NIGHTLIFE: Seoul. Koreans know how to party. Tokyo felt sleepy during the week. 


These are just my observations. I truly cant say which one I like more, both are amazing and worth thoroughly visiting.","these are the comments:
","Ive also done both and think that this is a great take. Thanks for the post, Seoul was more my vibe, but japan is a nicer place to vacation., I disagree on some things, but its probably due to me being SEAsian from a rd world country and the years I went to Tokyo and SeoulBusan for context. Accommodation Korea has comparatively cheaper and larger hotels, even if Im unsure if they were love hotels, but compared to Japans tiny business hotel, Ill take it. Food Really subjective, but its Japan for me cause everything is fresh and have I feel greater quality ingredients wise. Korean food feels way expensive for the quality tbh, when I can get the same quality at home for cheaper. Or possibly there not enough good Japanese places in my country, and maybe having more decent Korean restos heres. I do like Koreas culture of having a lot of sidedishes, but those probably what makes it more expensive. Navigation google maps in Japan is so good and can provide step by step guide on where to go, hurts my feet though, coming from a car centric country. Korea, due to war with the north, has outdated google map data and requires another app like naver to navigate, but they do have more escalators in their stations though. Long distance train quality was a step down in Korea I feel, specifically Busan one, but our trip also coincided with an event, with there not having enough seating for everyone on a long trip. Still way better from where Im from with scooter hell and vehicular pollution almost everywhere, so cant really complain. English infrastructure I think Japan has more available english signs and menus in my experience. Maybe its line dependent, but their train announcements cycle through English as well, compared to Korea where theres none iirc. Koreans do have more english speaking people and sort of understands more, in terms of the average person. I also have a bit of bias that I personally feel hiragana and katakana are easier to read than hangul. People Korea was weird but in a good way, we were far from East Asian looking but people would try to talk with us in Korean all the time. We would tell them we couldnt understand, and they would either apologize, situationally laugh of the mistake or would try to talk in english, but in general more friendly feeling and helped us out even without asking when we looked lost once. Japan feels more cold and apathetic I feel. I get it since I once worked in customer service and also coming from a homogenous country. But when something goes off script they sort of shortcircuit, for a lack of a better term, would pause and look at you in panic or frustration, with you most of the time have to compromise. Im an introvert so honestly prefer it, but IFF everything goes well. Culture wise I biasedly prefer Japan games, anime, etc, but not enough to actually live there only for vacations. Korea feels really brand, class and looks conscious for me, expensive cars and luxury brands are everywhere, could never fit in with my broke ass there. Might be the areas we went through, but both countries shops and restaurants do kinda closes too early. Japan in particular also opens way too late with earliest at mostly am, couldnt fit more restaurants to try out for breakfast. Way different to where Im from where people are out and about as early as am to as late as mn. Seeing from your post OP, Taiwans my next travel goal, hopefully can get the opportunity for next year or to go., I lived in Korea for a year and have visited many times since, spent a total of about two years there. Never lived in Japan but all visits combined have spent probably close to a year there now, although much more time outside of Tokyo than in the city. Agree with pretty much everything you said. Edit Actually I dont really find the nighttime drunkenness sketchy, but thats probably because Im a bit of a drunk myself. One thing that works in Koreas favour that I havent seen anyone mention is how easy it is to learn hangul. The first time I went there twentyplus years ago I had a little pocket Korean phrasebook with a guide on how to read hangul in the time it took me to fly from Vancouver to Incheon I had learned how to read all of the characters. Obviously I didnt know the meanings of many words but being able to read the characters phonetically is huge in itself. Good luck trying that with Japanese., Interesting. Ive been to both and was just in Seoul a few months ago. The food in Seoul is amazing. Its so fresh. Tokyo does get the edge because, well, its Tokyo, but I had amazing meals in Seoul. Also, the food is more approachable. Fried Chicken and beer is everywhere!? Haha. Amazing. The coffee in Seoul is better! I thought the people in Seoul and Tokyo were both so friendly. My wife was pregnant in Seoul and there were always pregnancy seats for her on the subway. Once a random kid was on his phone in a pregnancy seat not paying attention with the subway full. An older man nudged him and asked him to get up, then motioned for my wife to sit down. Ill never forget that. Japanese is easier to pronounce for me than Korean. It took me all week to nail down how the hell to pronounce hello and thank you. Also the bowing is such an easy way to express gratitude, hello, goodbye. Easier to communicate in Japan. Theres no sumo in Seoul., I visited both this September hard disagree on public transport in Seoul, and hotels we had great accommodation, cleanliness and service for a good price in a hostel in Tokyo Ginza and AWFUL conditions in a more expensive hostel in Seoul Myeongdong. I found Tokyo much more foreigner friendly, signage in Tokyo was immaculate and always bilingual, as well as announcements on the underground. Seoul was not always bilingual and important announcements line splitting and so on were not always in English. We ended up in unnecessarily dumb situations because we do not understand Korean. ALSO GOOGLE MAPS !!! Huge huge huge aspect of getting around and we found the Korean alternatives unusable as we dont understand Korean , I travel to Seoul and Tokyo regularly for business and pleasure. Some thoughts I dont think you can necessarily get a decent hotel room in Seoul for USD a night, unless were counting a windowless love motel room as a decent hotel room, and even then USD wouldnt get you much if anything Tokyo has an edge in the winter, but really should be off limits JuneAugust because of how hot and humid it gets Neither city is particularly foreigner friendly by the standards of a place like Singapore, evident from use of the term foreigner friendly itself, they both have their own insularity, cultural and linguistic bridges. I dont think everything is bilingual accurately describes Seoul by any means, its not Singapore, Hong Kong or Kuala Lumpur. People are roughly the same insular, polite and not really that interested in mingling with you on the whole, though Koreans typically speak better English than the Japanese I agree strongly that things are open much later, including shops, restaurants and nightlife My own thoughts Seoul is more fun if youre with somebody, especially if you want to go out Tokyo has better architecture and is more puttogether as a city, while Seoul is a bit grittier and a bit more inyourface Nice hotels and taxis in Tokyo are incredibly expensive, Seoul is much better in this regard, I really have to disagree about the people. Japanese do I lot of seemingly nice acts in public bowing, talking quietly, respecting personal space, generally having good manners, etc., but they will very often try to completely avoid any social interaction with you. Koreans might be louder and not as polite they are not rude either, though, however if you want to talk with them whether for assistance or just a chat, its very easy to do so. They are open for conversation with a foreigner, even if they only speak Korean they will happily translate with Papago. I think people often mistake the culture of politeness in Japan for the people being nice, but in my experience with perhaps the exception of Osaka, its actually a very cold and distant culture., lol. The only one id disagree with is Public Transit. Pricewise, Seoul is much cheaper and easier to navigate due to the entire system being covered by Korail., tokyo is the best. You will never go wrong with Japan. Ive been there times already. Ill never get tired of it, People probably mentioned it already, but public transit foreigner friendly part was so much more convenient for me in Tokyo ? Like, finding any place on Google maps is a nightmare in Korea, you need to use Naver Kakao maps, which is really not convenient. And even if you can find the place you want on google maps, you cant even pick the walking itinerary. Otherwise I guess both cities are both as good, but different, it just depends on what kind of experience youre looking for, Ive travelled and lived in both hats off for a great hot take! Though depends on your palate I prefer Korean food theres more flavour to it. In short Japanese food may be a bit flatbland but they pride in freshness and quality, whilst Korean food has loads of garlic, ginger and the works., deleted, Where did you find hotels at that price in Seoul? I remember finding lots of nice hotels in Busan for that price, but not in Seoul. My experience was that it was easier to find an ok budget hotel in Tokyo. At least in August and September this year. In November it looked more expensive in Tokyo too., My perspective as a frequent business traveler to both places, I love both. Food SeoulKorea has better spiced food while TokyoJapan feels simple and fresh. Fire and Ice. After I have a lot of Korean food, I would want to have some Japanese food. And vice versa. Now if we consider availability of other non local cuisines, Tokyo takes the gold by a mile. Transportation Korea is simpler for tourist going to main tourist spots but Tokyo gets you anywhere better. I had to take taxi in Seoul more often than when I visit Tokyo. Cost Seoul wins, but not by much. Weather I agree. Been to both locations in all seasons. Winter in Seouls winter was brutal for someone who grew up in tropical weather, and Tokyos summer is going to be tough to handle for those who love colder drier weather. Foreigner friendly Easier to get help in Tokyo. Seoul was fine but in Tokyo they have no problem going out of their ways to help you out. Nightlife I think this one depends on who you know and what you like ..., deleted, Personally I feel English is more widely accepted in Tokyo than in Seoul but I think it depends which parts youre in., I always found the Korean to be much friendlier and welcoming that the Japanese personally. Maybe faker, I dont know and dont really care. They are just better people to be around generally. Also, ENGLISH the younger Koreans are much more proficient in the language that their Japanese counterparts. I could easily find people who spoke very good English in Incheon, whereas the same in Tokyo is very rare. CLEANLINESS Japan, by a mile. Korean streets can be filthy and the concrete infrastructures often look awful., Ive never been to Japan but lived in Korea and I love Seoul. I returned as a tourist not that many years ago and had such a good time. People really overlook Korea as a destination in my opinion., The transport in Seoul isnt marginally better than Tokyo, its significantly better by leaps and bounds. Everything is clearly labeled in English. Theres no having to figure out which tickets for which lines, etc. Subway cars are much more spacious and less cramped feeling. This isnt even a close match.",respond to the question as if you're being asked directly given the comments as context,"this is the question:

Food Really subjective, but its Japan for me cause everything is fresh and have I feel greater quality ingredients wise. Korean food feels way expensive for the quality tbh, when I can get the same quality at home for cheaper. Or possibly there not enough good Japanese places in my country, and maybe having more decent Korean restos heres. I do like Koreas culture of having a lot of sidedishes, but those probably what makes it more expensive. Navigation google maps in Japan is so good and can provide step by step guide on where to go, hurts my feet though, coming from a car centric country. Korea, due to war with the north, has outdated google map data and requires another app like naver to navigate, but they do have more escalators in their stations though. Long distance train quality was a step down in Korea I feel, specifically Busan one, but our trip also coincided with an event, with there not having enough seating for everyone on a long trip. Still way better from where Im from with scooter hell and vehicular pollution almost everywhere, so cant really complain. English infrastructure I think Japan has more available english signs and menus in my experience. Maybe its line dependent, but their train announcements cycle through English as well, compared to Korea where theres none iirc. Koreans do have more english speaking people and sort of understands more, in terms of the average person. I also have a bit of bias that I personally feel hiragana and katakana are easier to read than hangul. People Korea was weird but in a good way, we were far from East Asian looking but people would try to talk with us in Korean all the time. We would tell them we couldnt understand, and they would either apologize, situationally laugh of the mistake or would try to talk in english, but in general more friendly feeling and helped us out even without asking when we looked lost once. Japan feels more cold and apathetic I feel. I get it since I once worked in customer service and also coming from a homogenous country. But when something goes off script they sort of shortcircuit, for a lack of a better term, would pause and look at you in panic or frustration, with you most of the time have to compromise. Im an introvert so honestly prefer it, but IFF everything goes well. Culture wise I biasedly prefer Japan games, anime, etc, but not enough to actually live there only for vacations. Korea feels really brand, class and looks conscious for me, expensive cars and luxury brands are everywhere, could never fit in with my broke ass there. Might be the areas we went through, but both countries shops and restaurants do kinda closes too early. Japan in particular also opens way too late with earliest at mostly am, couldnt fit more restaurants to try out for breakfast. Way different to where Im from where people are out and about as early as am to as late as mn. Seeing from your post OP, Taiwans my next travel goal, hopefully can get the opportunity for next year or to go., I lived in Korea for a year and have visited many times since, spent a total of about two years there. Never lived in Japan but all visits combined have spent probably close to a year there now, although much more time outside of Tokyo than in the city. Agree with pretty much everything you said. Edit Actually I dont really find the nighttime drunkenness sketchy, but thats probably because Im a bit of a drunk myself. One thing that works in Koreas favour that I havent seen anyone mention is how easy it is to learn hangul. The first time I went there twentyplus years ago I had a little pocket Korean phrasebook with a guide on how to read hangul in the time it took me to fly from Vancouver to Incheon I had learned how to read all of the characters. Obviously I didnt know the meanings of many words but being able to read the characters phonetically is huge in itself. Good luck trying that with Japanese., Interesting. Ive been to both and was just in Seoul a few months ago. The food in Seoul is amazing. Its so fresh. Tokyo does get the edge because, well, its Tokyo, but I had amazing meals in Seoul. Also, the food is more approachable. Fried Chicken and beer is everywhere!? Haha. Amazing. The coffee in Seoul is better! I thought the people in Seoul and Tokyo were both so friendly. My wife was pregnant in Seoul and there were always pregnancy seats for her on the subway. Once a random kid was on his phone in a pregnancy seat not paying attention with the subway full. An older man nudged him and asked him to get up, then motioned for my wife to sit down. Ill never forget that. Japanese is easier to pronounce for me than Korean. It took me all week to nail down how the hell to pronounce hello and thank you. Also the bowing is such an easy way to express gratitude, hello, goodbye. Easier to communicate in Japan. Theres no sumo in Seoul., I visited both this September hard disagree on public transport in Seoul, and hotels we had great accommodation, cleanliness and service for a good price in a hostel in Tokyo Ginza and AWFUL conditions in a more expensive hostel in Seoul Myeongdong. I found Tokyo much more foreigner friendly, signage in Tokyo was immaculate and always bilingual, as well as announcements on the underground. Seoul was not always bilingual and important announcements line splitting and so on were not always in English. We ended up in unnecessarily dumb situations because we do not understand Korean. ALSO GOOGLE MAPS !!! Huge huge huge aspect of getting around and we found the Korean alternatives unusable as we dont understand Korean , I travel to Seoul and Tokyo regularly for business and pleasure. Some thoughts I dont think you can necessarily get a decent hotel room in Seoul for USD a night, unless were counting a windowless love motel room as a decent hotel room, and even then USD wouldnt get you much if anything Tokyo has an edge in the winter, but really should be off limits JuneAugust because of how hot and humid it gets Neither city is particularly foreigner friendly by the standards of a place like Singapore, evident from use of the term foreigner friendly itself, they both have their own insularity, cultural and linguistic bridges. I dont think everything is bilingual accurately describes Seoul by any means, its not Singapore, Hong Kong or Kuala Lumpur. People are roughly the same insular, polite and not really that interested in mingling with you on the whole, though Koreans typically speak better English than the Japanese I agree strongly that things are open much later, including shops, restaurants and nightlife My own thoughts Seoul is more fun if youre with somebody, especially if you want to go out Tokyo has better architecture and is more puttogether as a city, while Seoul is a bit grittier and a bit more inyourface Nice hotels and taxis in Tokyo are incredibly expensive, Seoul is much better in this regard, I really have to disagree about the people. Japanese do I lot of seemingly nice acts in public bowing, talking quietly, respecting personal space, generally having good manners, etc., but they will very often try to completely avoid any social interaction with you. Koreans might be louder and not as polite they are not rude either, though, however if you want to talk with them whether for assistance or just a chat, its very easy to do so. They are open for conversation with a foreigner, even if they only speak Korean they will happily translate with Papago. I think people often mistake the culture of politeness in Japan for the people being nice, but in my experience with perhaps the exception of Osaka, its actually a very cold and distant culture., lol. The only one id disagree with is Public Transit. Pricewise, Seoul is much cheaper and easier to navigate due to the entire system being covered by Korail., tokyo is the best. You will never go wrong with Japan. Ive been there times already. Ill never get tired of it, People probably mentioned it already, but public transit foreigner friendly part was so much more convenient for me in Tokyo ? Like, finding any place on Google maps is a nightmare in Korea, you need to use Naver Kakao maps, which is really not convenient. And even if you can find the place you want on google maps, you cant even pick the walking itinerary. Otherwise I guess both cities are both as good, but different, it just depends on what kind of experience youre looking for, Ive travelled and lived in both hats off for a great hot take! Though depends on your palate I prefer Korean food theres more flavour to it. In short Japanese food may be a bit flatbland but they pride in freshness and quality, whilst Korean food has loads of garlic, ginger and the works., deleted, Where did you find hotels at that price in Seoul? I remember finding lots of nice hotels in Busan for that price, but not in Seoul. My experience was that it was easier to find an ok budget hotel in Tokyo. At least in August and September this year. In November it looked more expensive in Tokyo too., My perspective as a frequent business traveler to both places, I love both. Food SeoulKorea has better spiced food while TokyoJapan feels simple and fresh. Fire and Ice. After I have a lot of Korean food, I would want to have some Japanese food. And vice versa. Now if we consider availability of other non local cuisines, Tokyo takes the gold by a mile. Transportation Korea is simpler for tourist going to main tourist spots but Tokyo gets you anywhere better. I had to take taxi in Seoul more often than when I visit Tokyo. Cost Seoul wins, but not by much. Weather I agree. Been to both locations in all seasons. Winter in Seouls winter was brutal for someone who grew up in tropical weather, and Tokyos summer is going to be tough to handle for those who love colder drier weather. Foreigner friendly Easier to get help in Tokyo. Seoul was fine but in Tokyo they have no problem going out of their ways to help you out. Nightlife I think this one depends on who you know and what you like ..., deleted, Personally I feel English is more widely accepted in Tokyo than in Seoul but I think it depends which parts youre in., I always found the Korean to be much friendlier and welcoming that the Japanese personally. Maybe faker, I dont know and dont really care. They are just better people to be around generally. Also, ENGLISH the younger Koreans are much more proficient in the language that their Japanese counterparts. I could easily find people who spoke very good English in Incheon, whereas the same in Tokyo is very rare. CLEANLINESS Japan, by a mile. Korean streets can be filthy and the concrete infrastructures often look awful., Ive never been to Japan but lived in Korea and I love Seoul. I returned as a tourist not that many years ago and had such a good time. People really overlook Korea as a destination in my opinion., The transport in Seoul isnt marginally better than Tokyo, its significantly better by leaps and bounds. Everything is clearly labeled in English. Theres no having to figure out which tickets for which lines, etc. Subway cars are much more spacious and less cramped feeling. This isnt even a close match.respond to the question as if you're being asked directly given the comments as context","this is the question:
Travel tips no one asked for - Seoul vs. TokyoPeople compare Seoul and Tokyo a lot. Here‚Äôs my round up of what‚Äôs better and worse for each‚Ä¶

COST: Seoul. It‚Äôs not very expensive. you can get a decent hotel for like $30-50usd a night. public transit, food, alcohol are all pretty cheap. Tokyo gets pricey fast by comparison. 

PUBLIC TRANSIT: Seoul, by a slight margin. The metro system is amazing and easy to navigate. The busses are great too. Tokyo‚Äôs is remarkable and fascinating but can be very very confusing if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese.

WEATHER: Tokyo. Winter is prohibitively cold in Seoul.

FOOD: Tokyo. Not even really comparable IMO. Food in Seoul is good, food in Tokyo is better than anywhere else on Earth.

FOREIGNER FRIENDLY: Seoul. Everything is bilingual English/Korean in terms of signage, menus etc. Neither city has a high level of English proficiency but Seoul‚Äôs is marginally better.

PEOPLE: Tokyo. Japanese people are unimaginably welcoming and Tokyo feels absurdly safe. Korean people are more distant (to foreigners) and at nighttime there are too many drunk people around, it can feel sketchy. 

NIGHTLIFE: Seoul. Koreans know how to party. Tokyo felt sleepy during the week. 


These are just my observations. I truly cant say which one I like more, both are amazing and worth thoroughly visiting.these are the comments:

**Cost:**
Seoul tends to be less expensive across the board. Accommodations, food, and transport can offer better value for your money.

**Public Transit:**
Seoul’s system is highly praised for its ease of navigation, while Tokyo’s can be more complex, especially without Japanese language skills.

**Weather:**
Tokyo has milder winters, making it more comfortable for those not accustomed to the extreme cold that Seoul can experience.

**Food:**
Tokyo takes the crown for culinary excellence, offering unparalleled quality and variety. Seoul also has a delicious food scene, especially if you enjoy a bit of spice and side dishes.

**Foreigner-Friendly:**
Seoul might be slightly more accommodating with bilingual signage and a slightly higher level of English in common use.

**People:**
The people in Tokyo are known for their politeness and safety of the city, while in Seoul, the nightlife vibrancy adds to the city's charm.

**Nightlife:**
Seoul is well-regarded for its dynamic and energetic nightlife compared to Tokyo.

From the comments, it’s clear that people have different preferences based on their personal experiences. Some find Seoul to be more to their liking due to its vibe and approachability, while others favor Tokyo for its vacation qualities and offerings. 

A few have pointed out the ease of learning Hangul (Korean script) as an advantage in Seoul, and the English proficiency of younger Koreans seems to be relatively high. However, cleanliness is often cited as being superior in Tokyo.

Regardless, both cities are incredibly rich in culture, history, and modern attractions. It would be best to consider what aspects are most important for you and what kind of experience you are seeking.

Given that you’re looking for a mix of nature, nightlife, and cultural activities and considering the timeframe and your preference for convenience and budget, here are some suggestions combining your interests and the comments:

**Nashville, Tennessee:**
- Fly into Nashville for a day to experience its legendary nightlife, music scene, and great food. During the day, you can enjoy nearby nature spots or historical sites.

**Washington, D.C.:**
- This is another excellent option for a short flight. It offers world-class museums (all the Smithsonian museums are free), beautiful botanical gardens, and historical sights. Public transportation is convenient, and you wouldn’t need to rent a car.

**Chicago, Illinois:**
- A quick drive or train ride from Kalamazoo. Chicago has a vibrant nightlife, numerous museums, and the Chicago Botanic Garden. Plus, the Indiana Dunes National Park is not far, offering great hiking opportunities.

**Phoenix, Arizona:**
- Consider taking a short flight to Phoenix. You’ll find hiking, botanical gardens, and warmer weather if you’re seeking an escape from the cold. With a car rental, you could explore the Sonoran Desert or visit nearby Sedona for its stunning red rock landscapes.

**Traverse City or the Upper Peninsula, Michigan:**
- If you don’t mind the potential cold, northern Michigan can be beautiful, even in March. Traverse City has a quaint downtown area, and you might catch the tail end of winter beauty in the UP.

When considering flights, check out Allegiant Air from Grand Rapids for potentially cheaper options. Wherever you decide to go, booking accommodation a bit outside the city center can save money, especially if you’re renting a car. 

Wherever you choose to go, make sure to balance your desire for adventure with some relaxation time to celebrate your birthday.

- Fly into Nashville for a day to experience its legendary nightlife, music scene, and great food. During the day, you can enjoy nearby nature spots or historical sites.

**Washington, D.C.:**
- This is another excellent option for a short flight. It offers world-class museums (all the Smithsonian museums are free), beautiful botanical gardens, and historical sights. Public transportation is convenient, and you wouldn’t need to rent a car.

**Chicago, Illinois:**
- A quick drive or train ride from Kalamazoo. Chicago has a vibrant nightlife, numerous museums, and the Chicago Botanic Garden. Plus, the Indiana Dunes National Park is not far, offering great hiking opportunities.

**Phoenix, Arizona:**
- Consider taking a short flight to Phoenix. You’ll find hiking, botanical gardens, and warmer weather if you’re seeking an escape from the cold. With a car rental, you could explore the Sonoran Desert or visit nearby Sedona for its stunning red rock landscapes.

**Traverse City or the Upper Peninsula, Michigan:**
- If you don’t mind the potential cold, northern Michigan can be beautiful, even in March. Traverse City has a quaint downtown area, and you might catch the tail end of winter beauty in the UP.

When considering flights, check out Allegiant Air from Grand Rapids for potentially cheaper options. Wherever you decide to go, booking accommodation a bit outside the city center can save money, especially if you’re renting a car. 

Wherever you choose to go, make sure to balance your desire for adventure with some relaxation time to celebrate your birthday. Happy travels!"

Another thing I‚Äôll share as something that I think people should implement; kids not having their phones with them during the day on vacation. Normally they pull them out at any little lull in the action, and I just didn‚Äôt want to have that battle everyday. We‚Äôve invested way too much money and planning into this trip to have them playing Clash of Clans waiting while in line at Versailles or sitting on the subway in NY. They have no idea how much they miss out on during those ‚Äúboring‚Äù times staring at their phones. And that‚Äôs gone extremely well. They‚Äôre present and annoying, but they don‚Äôt seem to actively miss it and certainly don‚Äôt need it. 

I hope this is helpful or entertaining for someone!these are the comments:
deleted, I count bags! Come back to us when all of you are living out of one bag youll be crowned as the royal family!, I first read the title and half expected There are going to be people holding water bottles... ubersherpa hauling everything alone. OP, glad to see thats not the case. Looks like the start of many adventures, economical and flexible ones no less., Looks like freedom, That trip will give memories for the rest of yalls life. Love your phone idea, great solution to keep the kids engaged with their surroundings., You guys are rocking it right. I bought three backpacks for next trip to Istanbul and Taiwan. AER tp for me, mystery ranch ua, osprey daylite for my yo son. My yo daughter most probably will give up and ask others to carry her backpack so Ill skip her for the time being. My wife still hesitance on cutting the weight of her samsonite l luggage. but itll be a good start., Wow L. You just jumped in with both feet, eh? , That looks so much like Zurich but I cant quite place where the pics were taken and its bothering me. I gotta know. , Thats my city. Welcome to Zurich Switzerland, enjoy your trip. Good job on the backpacks for people. I got my family to go personal item only, but so far only for shorter trips., Im the only one bagger in my family and we are in EU rn too and Im sick of waiter for them in airport terminals in baggage claim lol., Hows the laundryaromatic situation with the whole fam I mean the teens? Also I mean is one person stuck with the laundry I am pretty sure that it would be me in my family. I am reluctant to embark on something like this, but it could be the best thing ever, How long is your trip? Are you changing accommodations every few days?, After college I travelled through Europe for a month with one backpack. Definitely doable. No cellphones back then so my friends will take turns carrying the heavy guidebooks lol, How are you doing this phone thing!?!?! I want details for my own implementation. Thanks!, Our family one bagged it for a London a few years ago...it was great! Well, not entirely. We went to London to meet up with our daughter who had just finished a semester abroad in Toledo, Spain. She had more luggage that the the three of us us and our son combined!, Excited to see the same REI trail that is also frequently my onebag. Great bag, Hello fellow poor decision maker! We just touched down in Europe with our family of , though, a younger age spread with our kids. We cheat a bit though. The kids are packed in L bags one each, but my wife and I each bring a domesticcarryon sized roller bag, and a small daypack. Weve found that like literally minutes ago with the little ones the roller bags serve doubleduty as both a dolly for their luggage, and impromptu stroller as were making our way through airports with jet lagged kids. It keeps us from going bagfeefree on discount carriers, but nearly all our flying is on points and miles, so weve never had an issue with domesticsized carryon allowances. Honestly, without oneishbagging I think international travel with a big family would be so much of a hassle we just wouldnt do it. And that would be terrible., removed, Thanks! Yeah its really the way to go and I hope the kids keep this in mind as they go through life., Funny! When I saw your comment I realized, yes my wife does carry a small purse but you cant see it in these pictures. Technicality! We will have to work on our one family, one bag.respond to the question as if you're being asked directly given the comments as context","Onebagging through Europe with a family is an impressive feat! Your approach to pack light and manage with <30L bags each is commendable. It definitely saves time and worry about lost luggage and makes moving from place to place easier. The USB extension cable, moleskin, folding scissors, and repair kit are great examples of items that aren’t minimalist per se but offer practical solutions on the road.

Your decision to keep phones away from the kids during the day to ensure everyone is engaged and present is wise. It encourages everyone to soak in the experience and make the most of the travel time, which can be quite enriching.

The responses suggest that you're creating lasting memories and setting an excellent example of travel efficiency. Whether it’s Zurich or elsewhere, the philosophy of carrying your life in a backpack seems to resonate with many and inspires others to consider light travel, even for international trips.

For those considering a similar approach, start with short trips and see how it works for your family dynamics. It's all about finding the right balance between convenience and comfort. Embracing the onebag lifestyle can indeed lead to more spontaneous and enriching travel experiences. Safe travels and enjoy the journey!","Onebagging through Europe with a family is an impressive feat! Your approach to pack light and manage with <30L bags each is commendable.

","I like spas, clubsbars, good food, video games, anime, technology, and open to exploring. Just gonna add to the previous answers Baiyun is huge, so its hard to give you precise distance estimates. That said, for most of your list, Zhujiang New Town and Yuexiu will be kind of hubs food, clubs, bars, etc. There is a place called Comic City connected to metro lines and in Yuexiu, but Ive never been myself. I just see quite a lot of teenagers cosplaying to and from there on weekends especially. Baiyun itself has quite a lot of outdoors stuff to do, like hiking, bungee jumping, etc. There are many beautiful parks around the city that are worth visiting. The biggest question for these is the weather, so its complicated to give suggestions months ahead. One tourist point I have not seen mentioned yet is Beijing Road, which is basically a shoppingfood street area that is surrounded by historical landmarks. Technology sounds vague to me. What are you looking for on this one? Buying stuff? There are electronics markets all over the place, in Tianhe you can find a few different buildings around one called Guangzhou Computer Market line , Gangding station is closest. If youre looking for showrooms to see new stuff, Im not sure what besides the Canton Fair, but its held in April and November, so you will arrive after the second one is done. There are booths to show stuff at several shopping malls around the city, but I dont know how to find schedules for those. Without speaking Mandarin or Cantonese, expect to have some trouble getting around. Locals who can speak English are a minority, and often they get scared to death by the mere sight of a foreigner, so communication gets very hard. I recommend installing maps that work in China beforehand Apple Maps is decent and researching itineraries before leaving your place. If you dont want to take metro and bus both are excellent in Guangzhou, but during peak hours theyre both overcrowded, get DiDi, the Chinese Uber. Im not sure how payment works with it if you cant get a Chinese account linked, though. One good news is that since youre planning this with a lot of leeway, you can try to be ready for these gotchas and reduce issues. Getting a local SIM card with a lot of data and setting up payment on WeChat and Alipay should be some of the first things to do upon arrival. Theyll make your stay a lot less painful. Good luck! Edit Guangzhou also has quite a lot of historical spots to visit, one I like is Panyu Shawan Ancient Town. Panyu itself is similar to Baiyun in the sense that its a gigantic district that is basically its own city, so you can find lots of different stuff to do there. As a friend described Guangzhou to someone else. GZ is basically split into kinds of areas Tianhe is the modern downtown a bit too western for a lot of people districts like Baiyun and Panyu are basically their own cities inside of Guangzhou and districts like Yuexiu, Liwan and Haizhu are more traditional Guangzhou. Lastly, Foshan is also a very nice place to visit. Some people like Dongguan as well, but Ive never been. Ive heard its a mostly industrial place though., is one of the coolest speakeasies in China. Very creative cocktails by any standard and live jazz in the lounge area. Its not easy to find. The opening is a false pantry shelf in the back of a fake restaurant. Perfect for a date night. You will need a reservation in advance I havent been in years so it could be closed for all I know. It was founded and run by a Swiss guy and got so popular they opened up branches in other locations and cities Called Hope Sesame in English if Im not mistaken, Go to the top of GZ tower and do the bubble type cars at the top. Id wait until the sun is setting so you can see the city during daynight. Id also suggest hitting up Macao and HK since you are really close, spend days in both and at least feel the difference. Baiyun mountain has bungee jumping, Ive never been but Ive heard its pretty rad. Internet cafes require a Chinese ID so unless you plan on playing LoL or something with another, that might be out of the question. If you are into arcade games, Grandview mall has a massive arcade at the top floor and an ice skating rink too. Panyu has some amusementwater parks and zoos if you are into that and will be about an hour on the metro from Baiyun. I havent lived in GZ for about years but as far as I know, these places are still active, Hope that you are staying in the developed part of Baiyun. Baiyun is big, you could be a minute metro ride away from downtown or it could be minutes. If you like spas make sure you go experience Chinese hotsprings in one of the resorts in Conghua. Instead of going up the Canton tower I suggest you go to any of the top floor bars at Huacheng square Rosewood for example, have a fancy tea, and enjoy the view of the tower itself.

Although you’re not fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese, many younger locals and service industry workers have a basic understanding of English, and you’ll also find translation apps immensely helpful.

For your interests in spas, clubs/bars, and good food, Zhujiang New Town and Yuexiu district offer plenty of options. Check out Comic City for anime and gaming culture. Baiyun district offers outdoor activities like hiking and bungee jumping if the weather permits. Technology-wise, the Guangzhou Computer Market and electronics markets throughout Tianhe could be of interest. However, given the post-Covid changes, always check the current status of these venues before planning your visit.

For cultural experiences and some historical flavor, Panyu Shawan Ancient Town is a good place to explore. For evenings out, you might enjoy speakeasy bars like ""Hope & Sesame"" in Dongshankou for a unique experience and live jazz music, although reservations are recommended.

Using apps like DiDi for transportation can be convenient, but setting up payment without a Chinese account might be challenging. Early on, getting a local SIM card and setting up WeChat and Alipay will significantly ease your stay. These platforms are widely used for payment and communication in China.

Remember that Guangzhou can be quite cold in December, so pack accordingly. Enjoy your trip, and embrace the adventure of discovering a new city, its culture, and its technological advancements. And don’t forget to sample the local Cantonese cuisine—it’s a culinary delight not to be missed!","Guangzhou is a vibrant city with a rich blend of traditional culture and modern amenities, making it an exciting place for your three-week stay in December. Although you’re not fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese, many younger locals and service industry workers have a basic understanding of English, and you’ll also find translation apps immensely helpful.

For your interests in spas, clubs/bars, and good food, Zhujiang New Town and Yuexiu district offer plenty of options. Check out Comic City for anime and gaming culture. Baiyun district offers outdoor activities like hiking and bungee jumping if the weather permits. Technology-wise, the Guangzhou Computer Market and electronics markets throughout Tianhe could be of interest.

Going to Europe for 2 Months (May/June). Any specific city/region recommendations other than the main tourist attractions? Looking for hidden gemEdit: You all are amazing‚Ä¶ now I dont think 2months is enough to experience all the amazing places mentioned below. Time to re-budget and add an additional month I think. Hahathese are the comments:
If you happen upon the Czech Republic, esk Krumlov is about a thirty minute train ride. Its a medieval village complete with castle, cobblestones, labyrinthine walls, with winding river around it. Its breathtaking., Gimmelwald Switzerland is magical!, Malta is beautiful, Lake Bled in Slovenia! Or Madeira Island!, The Dolomites in northern Italy. Alpes de suisi in particular., Pula or nearby Rovinj in northern Croatia. The more Popular destinations of Dubrovnik Split are fantastic, but if you want that smaller hidden gem feel, I love Pula. Amphitheatre there is amazing, Rovinj is very picturesque you can get a bus between Pula and Rovinj, and you can get a boat over to Brijuni island which is a very nice national park., The Valis is Switzerland is fantastic. Bayerischer Wald in Germany is like going back in time To me its mostly about experiences, there use to be a brewery in the hills above Salzburg run by monks. Also the Ice Caves near Salzburg is well worth a trip. Peel away your insecurities with a vusit to one of the many Wellness spas in any German or Dutch speaking country., Budapest is a great go to for an affordable good time, Slovenia Ljubljana, Bovec and soca valley, Piran., Its so wide and varied that it truly depends what you wanna do. I love the beach so Athens for culture then onwards on the ferry to Kefalonia, Crete and the major isles. For shopping Paris or Frankfurt. For polish pottery Boleslaweic in Poland and cool beer baths Pilsen where the beer is brewed. For chic and showtunes London with an escape to Stonehenge. Croatia is good for beach partying. If you like diving Malta has some nice wrecks and cool culture. Absolutely loved Lisbon, Portugal and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Barcelona, Budapest and Prague aslp worth a visit. Its a long list as I lived years in Germany. Happy traveling., Maybe not a hidden gem but Krakow Poland is awesome and is affordable, Ive visited every European country except three microstates, and there are so many hidden gems, but so much depends on your interests and budget, particularly since you are going for two months at the beginning of peak season. Without knowing these, I will share some of my discoveries and gems that bear in mind a moderate budget which leaves out many of my favorites in westernnorthern Europe . Central Europe Krakow, Prague, CzeskyKrumlov, Vienna expensive, Bratislava maybe, Budapest...then add Transylvania, particularly the Saxon towns .
