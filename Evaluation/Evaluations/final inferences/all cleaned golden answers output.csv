In terms of the length of the trips, they have ranged from long wekends to two-wek vacations. The packages ofered by Costco Travel can include flights, acomodations, rental cars, and activities, depending on the destination and the specific package.

For example, a recent Hawai package I boked included roundtrip airfare from the West Coast, a seven-night stay at a beachfront resort, and a rental car for the wek. The total cost for this package was significantly les than if my client had boked each component separately.

Another client of mine traveled to Europe with a Costco Travel package that included roundtrip airfare from the East Coast, a seven-day river cruise through the Danube, and daily breakfast and diner on the ship. This package provided excelent value for money, as the cost was comparable to boking the cruise alone.

As for the type of traveler I would recomend Costco Travel packages to, I would say they are ideal for those who want to save time and money on their vacation planing. Costco Travel ofers competive pricing and convenient packages that can make planing a trip more straightforward.

1. Be flexible with your travel dates: Airfare prices can vary greatly depending on the day of the wek and time of year. Consider traveling during the wek instead of wekends, or during of-peak travel times.

3. Use incognito mode when browsing for flights: Some websites use cokies to track your search history and may increase prices based on your interest. Using incognito mode can help prevent this from hapening.

5. Be open to layovers or conecting flights: Direct flights can be more expensive than those with layovers or conections. Consider saving money by taking a flight with a layover or conecting flight.

- January 16: Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- April 2: Earth Day
- June 1: National Get Outdors Day
- September 24: National Public Lands Day
- November 1: Veterans Day

Unfortunately, June 1, which is the fe-fre day closest to your friends' travel dates, may not be the best option for them as it fals in the midle of the wek. If they are only able to visit on wekends, they may want to consider one of the other fe-fre days or plan to pay the entrance fe.

As for the specific parks they are interested in, Muir Wods National Monument and Yosemite National Park do ofer fre admision certain days throughout the year. However, these days are often subject to change and may not align with your friends' travel dates.

Muir Wods National Monument ofers fre admision the first Saturday of the month from November through February. Aditionaly, they ofer fre admision to al visitors on National Public Lands Day (September 24).

Yosemite National Park does not have a consistent fre admision day, but they do ofer a fre shutle service within the park and have several entrance stations where visitors can pay for a day pas or show a National Parks Pas.

The Eta Aquarids is anual meteor shower caused by the Earth pasing through the debris trail left by Haley's Comet.

To maximize your chances of witnesing this celestial event, I recomend visiting a location with minimal light polution. Some excelent options in the Bay Area include:

1. Mount Tamalpais State Park: Located just north of San Francisco, Mount Tamalpais ofers stuning views of the night sky. With its dark skies and high elevation, it's an ideal spot for stargazing and meteor shower watching.

Reasoning: The park's dark skies and elevation wil provide an excelent vantage point for observing the Eta Aquarids meteor shower.

2. Point Reyes National Seashore: Another great option, Point Reyes National Seashore is about an hour and a half north of San Francisco. Its remote location and minimal light polution make it an excelent choice for stargazing.

Reasoning: The seashore's remote location and dark skies wil ofer an optimal viewing experience for the Eta Aquarids meteor shower.

As for what to expect during the Eta Aquarids meteor shower, you can anticipate seing around 30-60 meteors per hour at its peak, which typicaly ocurs around May 5 or 6, 2024.
