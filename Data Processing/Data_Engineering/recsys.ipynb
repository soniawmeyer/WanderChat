Rest are ranging from 20 min to hours of delay. \\\\n\\\\nHave made plenty of short stopovers before, 50 min in Changi, 55 in Doha, 1h 25 min in sfo (intl-dom), but this Frankfurt one is the first one I’m almost certain to not make, or if I make it my bag might not. And after reading through r/lufthansa it seems like Frankfurt is a blackhole for lost bags from misconnections \\\\n\\\\nCalled Lufthansa to express my concern for this hard to make connection and asked for it to be changed to maybe 2 hours, and got told it’s not part of the fare rule. \\\\n\\\\nSo just gonna bite the bullet and fly non stop\\\\n\\\\n(And I accept my fault for picking such a short stopover in the first place haha)\\']', 'response': \" Based on the information provided in the context, it appears that some Reddit users have shared their experiences with connecting flights at Dubai International Airport (DXB) with relatively short layovers, particularly with Qatar Airways. They generally seem to express confidence in making these connections due to Qatar Airways' reliability and on-time performance. However, one user has had a negative experience with a tight connection at Frankfurt airport with Lufthansa, raising concerns about lost bags and missing flights.In the context of the original question, it seems that the traveler is asking if they will have enough time to make a connection between two separate flights from the same airport, Dubai International Airport, with a layover of approximately 5 hours. Given the information provided, it appears that this connection might be viable depending on various factors such as the efficiency of immigration and customs processes, baggage reclaim, and check-in procedures. However, there is a mention that midnight tends to be a busy time at Dubai airport, which could potentially make things more challenging.Considering these points, it's important to note that individual experiences can vary greatly when it comes to air travel, and what worked well for some users might not work as smoothly for others. The traveler should consider checking with the airlines and airport authorities regarding any specific procedures or recommendations for their particular situation. Additionally, they may want to factor in any potential delays or complications that could arise during the connection process. Ultimately, while a 5-hour layover might be considered tight for some, it is still technically within the realm of possibility based on the experiences shared by some Reddit users with similar connections at Dubai International Airport.\"})]"
