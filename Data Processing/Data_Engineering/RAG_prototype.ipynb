            "Newbie ISO advice - which cruise line for our list of \"don't wants\"\n",
            "['Unless you’re prepared to go with one of the luxury cruises or Virgin Voyages then there will be kids. All ships have a smoking area. \\n\\nI’ve done NCL, Princess, RCCL and I liked the food on NCL but that’s subjective. Same with entertainment on board. Excursions are easy to book but you’ll need to line up to board etc. \\n\\nBut I’m not sure that cruising is right for you. A lot of your not wants will pretty much happen on all cruise lines depending on time of year. There will be lines, you’ll need to book to dine at speciality restaurants,', 'Welcome!  You\\'re asking a lot of the right questions and thinking about things in the right way.  Whenever folks look to cruise, I tell them to consider using a good travel agent to guide them through the madness and help get them the best deal, and to consider what made them think of cruising in the first place.  What things have you seen that are appealing, and what do you want to avoid?  \\n\\nI\\'ll go through some of your core points (many which resonate with my personal preferences) and comment on them.\\n\\n* *Casual dress: no required suits or dresses, the more casual the better.*   \\nNCL and Virgin will be the standouts here, but most won\\'t be as far off as you think.  With limited exception, lines aren\\'t that formal these days.  Many will have a night or two that is more dressy, but suits and long dresses aren\\'t required by most dress codes now.  Wearing a button down shirt and pants, on most lines, is plenty on those formal nights.  On the rest, most lines just ask you don\\'t wear shorts.  NCL has no significant dress code in most restaurants, and Virgin\\'s only rule is no swimwear.\\n* *NO SMOKING (ideally anywhere on the ship, though it seems that\\'s impossible to find).*  \\nMost lines allow indoor smoking in the casino, and they\\'ll have an outdoor smoking section or two.  There may also be an enclosed cigar lounge.  There are exceptions.  **Celebrity** doesn\\'t allow smoking anywhere indoors, **Oceania** doesn\\'t allow smoking in the casino (just in a \"fishbowl\" inside of one lounge, well separated/sealed off), and **Virgin** only allows smoking inside of a room that has two doors to go through with a separate ventilation system.  I don\\'t love smoke, and I can honestly say that if you stood at the door you\\'d never have any idea what\\'s happening on the other side.  There may be some other lines here (river lines, for one) that don\\'t have indoor smoking, but I\\'d need to check.\\n* *No kids (or as few as possible!)*  \\nContemporary lines (NCL, Royal, Carnival, MSC) cater to a wide range of folks including those with kids, so you\\'ll find far more kids on these lines.  Two big factors reduce kids:   \\n1) Going up market to premium (HAL/Princess/Celebrity), lite-luxury, and luxury lines.    \\n2)  Longer voyages.  The longer the sailing, the fewer kids.  \\nOf course, avoiding school breaks is a big factor, too.  \\n**Virgin Voyages** is 18+, as is **Viking** if you\\'re looking at smaller-ship high end experiences.  Otherwise it\\'s longer sailings/non-vacation sailings on **Celebrity**, **HAL**, or **Princess**, and those further up market..\\n* *Minimal \"upcharges\" or at least no unpleasant surprises (no $20 bottled beer!)*   \\nThere are a few ways to look at this.  Some lines let you build more into your fare (drink packages, dining packages, etc) - that way you\\'re set up front for more things.  NCL does this, but also has a higher percentage of specialty dining and upcharge entertainment options.  Broadly speaking, as you go up market, more is included.  Go far enough up market and excursions are even included.  If you\\'re Staying with premium and contemporary lines, the clear winner here is **Virgin Voyages**.  They have many dining venues, all of which are included, plus gratuities and wifi are built into your fare.  They don\\'t have drink packages, but they tend to have lower drink prices.\\n* *High quality, well prepared food that is not so gourmet/fancy as to be unrecognizable to non-foodies (think NY strip or prime rib, lobster, fresh seafood, local island delicacies, high quality Mexican/Italian/Thai/etc. and NOT all-you-can-eat buffets, and also NOT gimmicky bougie flowers-on-a-plate or dancing cartoon tacos.*  \\nThis may be the hardest one, since food is so incredibly subjective.  Again, as you go up market, most would agree that food gets better, but not all.  I think the term foodie is trash (not knocking you, just using it as a point of clarification) b/c it seems anyone who likes to eat uses that term.  We all like to eat.  **HAL** (Holland America Line) and **Celebrity**, IMHO, do a great job with food, especially at their price points.  They\\'re also pretty traditional in terms of menus (with the exception of a restaurant or two).  I actually think **Carnival** has some of the best and most varied complimentary dining options.  Personally, I find **Oceania** and **Virgin Voyages** to have the best cuisine.  Oceania\\'s is going to be a bit fancier while classic, Virgin\\'s is a bit more inventive, though, except for Test Kitchen (one of their restaurants), I don\\'t think it\\'s very out there.  Again, this is all very subjective.  All lines have buffets as an option, except for Virgin, who has more of a food hall concept in it\\'s place (a concept Norwegian Prima/Viva have in addition to a buffet).\\n* *Minimal hassle dining requirements (no set times, would prefer not to have to make advance reservations for just 2 people, no forced seating with strangers).*  \\nAlmost every line has anytime dining options now - just ask your agent to note that preference for you.  Most lines offer the option of reservations, and while it may be helpful for some specific restaurants, I make very few reservations, and across many cruises, have yet to go hungry.  Still, folks will get very upset about racing to make reservations, treat it like it\\'s mandatory, etc.  I dunno why.  No one requires it.  \\nKnow that most lines have one or more main dining rooms, a buffet, and specialty restaurants that come at an upcharge (for each meal/item, or via a package).  Some lines don\\'t charge for specialty dining, but that\\'s mostly lite-luxury and higher (again, Oceania is an example here).  Virgin Voyages doesn\\'t have the concept of a main dining room, and dining is all included.  No lines make you sit with strangers.  Some lines, if you have fixed seating (which again, you don\\'t have to do except on DCL and Cunard) may assign you a shared table, but you just ask for a private table and problem solved.\\n* *No unmanageably huge crowds that make every little thing difficult (finding a pool lounge, not getting shut out of excursion sign-ups, whatever).*   \\nAs you go up market, there is more space for each passenger, and fewer passengers per crew member.  So, go up market and crowds thin out a lot, and service tends to improve.  Carnival has the most densely packed ships.  Really, to avoid crowding, stick with premium lines and above.\\n* *Varied, not boring music/entertainment options.*   \\nNon-boring is subjective.  No lines advertise or tout boring entertainment.  It depends what type of entertainment is interesting to you.  Watch videos, check sites, read past daily programs to see what resonates.\\n* *A casino would be fun, but in case I haven\\'t mentioned, NO SMOKING.*  \\n**Celebrity, Oceania, and Virgin Voyages** are, to my recollection, the only lines with no smoking at all in the casinos.  I\\'m sure if I\\'m forgetting someone it will get mentioned.\\n* *Fun, adult events and shore excursions that don\\'t require a lot of advance planning.*  \\nMost events on ships don\\'t require advanced planning at all.  Much like dining, reservations may sometimes be available, but for most things, on most lines, they\\'re not required.  Exceptions might be small group events, such as mixology classes.  Holland America, and to some extent Princess, will be a bit quieter in terms of activities.  Same goes for lines further up market on smaller ships.  The more traditional premium line that has the most entertainment/activity options tends to be **Celebrity**.  \\nExcursions sell out sometimes - it\\'s best not to wait, however, you\\'re never limited by the excursions offered by cruise lines.  There are TONS of third parties offering tours, often less likely to sell out, often cheaper, and often with smaller group sizes.  \\n*  *Nice pool, hot tub, and sauna facilities are appreciated, though fitness centers are not a priority.*  \\nI\\'ll let someone else speak to sauna availability here, as I have no idea.  Pools and hot tubs are popular places and can fill.  Again, look for lines that are less densely packed, and avoid kids, and that\\'s generally a much easier proposition.  \\n\\nI\\'m late for recording an intro for a video, so I\\'ll leave it there, but happy to answer/clarify anything.', 'Virgin Voyages ticks all your boxes. Ships are on the smaller side, everything is super casual, lovely food, no buffet. The casino is small but smoke-free. Drink prices are pretty reasonable, at least in the context of being on a cruise ship! VV is a lot of things but “boring” is not one of them. \\n\\nCelebrity could work, especially if you book on an Edge-class ship, but you’d need either a perfectly timed cruise or longer cruise (8 days minimum) to truly minimize children onboard. One irritant about Celebrity is that they have an adult-only pool area on all ships but it’s placed between a bank of elevators and the main pool - so it’s a thoroughfare and you’ll have families walking through frequently. \\n\\nOther options… eh, no need to overthink this. Book Virgin Voyages.', 'Cruising is not for you lmao', 'Outside of the super casual dress this sounds like Celebrity. They have a few formal nights, at least the one I went on, but it wasn’t required. Basically if men wear jeans and a polo they fit in perfectly and ladies a nice top and skirt. \\n\\nNot a lot of kids, good food, shows were a tier above Norwegian and the basic drink package covered every drink under $15.', 'Try an all inclusive adult resort', 'Celebrity Edge class ships tick all the boxes really.  I never went on a cruise with so few kids and was so impressed with decor, food, drinks, literally everything.  Have sailed the other main ones and they have a lot of kids when they have the water slides, ropes, bumper cars etc.  Even when it’s not school break time they will be there.', 'Stay home', 'Virgin is likely the best fit for your preferences - no dress code, no kids, chill/relaxed vibe, good food, no buffet, no main dining room, no nickel and diming - wifi, tips, sodas, and all restaurants included.  But it works best if you reserve restaurants and entertainment each night.  Also, there are less entertainment options than Royal Caribbean.  Maybe check out some YouTube videos to see if it meets your needs.  As for smoking, they only allow it in one outside area and in one small separate Casino room - not in the main Casino.', 'Yea your wants in my opinion can’t be found on a cruise ship. I’m not sure if there is a place on earth that would fill the bill. \\nBut hey it’s nice to have standards', \"You don't want a cruise. You want a resort somewhere.\", \"Yeah, modern day cruising isn't going to accommodate your list. Even if you throw a lot of money at it.\\n\\nBut if you can throw money at it, then Windstar will work.\", \"Causal dress, I'd pick Norwegian. I prefer dressing up and stick to Cunard or Princess for that. When I want to chill out and NOT dress, NCL.\\n\\nYou can avoid kids by not travelling during school breaks. There are higher end lines that are zero kids, it depends if you want to spend that high.\\n\\nUpcharges happen. Buy whatever drink package the ship has; plus there's usually a tacked on gratuity. Internet is extra. Some cruises include this stuff, but they do cost more. Mentally I just accept the overall total and don't think about it. It's more me looking at the total and then deciding if I can live with it.\\n\\nCrowds really are ship and trip dependent.\\n\\nAll the cruises I've been on have a smoking section, but except for those that allow smoking in the casino, I never smell it.\\n\\nNCL has freestyle dining. No reservations necessary for the regular dining rooms. You'd probably need them for specialty dining but I can make them same day if I am flexible.\\n\\nA lot of what you're thinking about is just... learning how to cruise. Once you find your lines you like, it gets WAY easier.\", 'Direct answer: Viking Ocean.', 'Celebrity scores well on just about all the items in your list!', \"I haven't sailed on Virgin, but I've sailed on Celebrity, Princess, Carnival, & NCL, & I'd recommend Celebrity.  As someone else mentioned - check out their Edge category ships...\", \"Dress code: most mainstream lines have become much more flexible on dress code. On normal days, just having pants (or shorts that are not swim trunks) and a shirt will be fine. If there is a fancy dress/fine dining day, dressing business casual is good enough. Or make that a day to skip main dining and eat at one of the other dining options onboard.\\n\\nNo kids: Virgin is practically the only adult only line you see but you can minimize kids on any line by not sailing during school holidays and taking a vacation over 7 days.  I was on a 9 night cruise in May and saw only 4 children the whole time. \\n\\nFood is pretty similar across most lines. If you want casual (burgers/fried chicken) Carnival does that best. If you are looking for something more like a nice sit-down meal, Celebrity usually wins awards for their food. If you are satisfied with the level of something like an average chain restaurant (Applebee's) anywhere, will give you that. Seafood on the sea is really plentiful and usually a nice quality. If you are a fan of seafood, I'd worry about this choice even less. \\n\\nNo hassle dining is probably best done by NCL'S freestyle dining. No reservations needed for main dining. You can make reservations for specialty dining but they will also make every effort to get you in if you just show up. In all cases, there is some risk you'll be table sharing. You can request a table for just your party but, depending on crowds and availability, you may have to share. Just be aware that this is a thing. \\n\\nEvery ship will have limited seating at pools, shows and excursions. There is no escaping that. Just plan ahead for things you really want to experience and book/arrive early. \\n\\nYou can expect every ship to have a mix of music at all times. Even small ships will have a guitar playing in a bar while there is a piano playing in the lounge. Don't worry about music, there is a lot and it is varied. You can expect a theater show on each ship. Some lines will have licensed plays like Hairspray or Beetlejuice, while others have shows that the line produces themselves. These are ship specific (not by line), so look at your specific ship to see what's showing off you care about that. Royal Caribbean is generally thought to have the best entertainment with all the above included plus ice skating and water diving shows on larger ships.\\n\\nYou won't find a ship that is no smoking but smoking is limited to the casino and designated smoking areas on all ships. Some ships will also have seperate non smoking casino areas too. If you can avoid the casino, you are usually fine. \\n\\nExcursions should be chosen and booked ahead on any line. They are very easy to find once you've docked and will return you to the port area. This applies to all lines. \\n\\nPools and hot tubs are standard on cruises. Virgin has the worst ratio of pools to guests (only 1 on many ships). The more family oriented your line, the more pool space you'll find devoted to children. It's best to search ship by ship to see what's available. Saunas are on most ships but are nearly always an upcharge for a spa pass.\", 'We’re on a Viking cruise right now, we’ve cruised with RCL, Holland, Celebrity & once on NCL, we wanted a more upscale product. \\n\\nThere’s no casino onboard but the service & food is spectacular. No lines anywhere. High quality steak & seafood every night (including very good sushi nightly at the buffet, which I get you’re not into but this is an excellent buffet). \\n\\nWe’re trying Virgin & Azamara within the next 12 months to see which line we will choose to go with in the future.', \">No unmanageably huge crowds that make every little thing difficult (\\n\\nYou gotta go in off season, which is a concept that's been obliterated since COVID.\", 'You might like Viking Ocean. \\n\\n\\\\* No one is under 18.

You can have a great cruise without paying an extra cent.   \\n\\\\* Ships are gorgeous  \\n\\\\* If you are in the lowest category of stateroom or the highest suite, no one will know after you are on board. Everyone has access to everything.   \\n\\\\* Longer cruises in more exotic places. I won’t fly to Europe for a 7 night cruise. Other than the Baltic, that’s about all X does anymore. Most of our X cruises were 14 nights minimum. Viking has 7, 14, 21, 28 night cruises. That’s worth going to Europe for.  \\n\\\\* A focus on ports and traveling. We are doing a 21 night with them in September from Athens to Barcelona with NO sea days. It will be exhausting but at least there are four overnights (Athens, Venice, Livorno, Barcelona). We go to a lot of small towns in Greece, the Adriatic and the back side of Italy’s boot.  \\n\\\\* Much more interesting food', 'I think you’d really like Virgin Voyages. It’s known to have great food with no buffet dining. Super fun and NO KIDS!!!', 'We mostly cruise Princess but it doesn’t fit a bunch of your don’t wants, primarily food.  The food can be great but there are also times it misses out lately.  We started cruising Oceania about 5 years ago and find in general it is a better fit for us and mostly addresses all your don’t wants just fine (except the no smoking…it is limited however and I’ve never noticed it as an issue.)\\n\\nThe only slight issue I have with Oceania is it has port heavy itineraries.  I cruise to relax and I love being on the ocean, actually cruising, as opposed to spending 8+ hours in port every day.  So I prefer lots of sea days to balance out the ports.  Oceania has very few itineraries that meet this with the exception of the transoceanics.  But, when we can find them they are a much more enjoyable cruise than other lines.  And they have the best libraries afloat!  Think old style mansion type libraries with tons of comfy chairs to relax in.\\n\\n(We still cruise Princess for the great itineraries and also the price.  For what we pay on Oceania we can get a nice suite on Princess.)', 'Thanks to all who provided thoughtful responses (far more that I expected!)   A lot to think about.  Much appreciated!', \"Virgin Voyages is adults only and no up sales! They have a come dressed as you are policy. They just prohibit swim suits in the dining room. That's the only restriction. They sail out of Miami and passports are required. They won numerous awards from Cruise Critic in 2023.\", 'Happen to be sitting with my mom so I asked her. She recommended Viking or Oceania.', 'Try for a smaller ship with fewer things like casinos, slides, pools, and shows. These are often luxury lines. It depends on what you want and what you are prepared to pay.', \"I'm surprised I haven't seen Azamara mentioned here. The only smoking area is a small outdoor area on the pool deck. No casinos at all. Great food, great band every night, a pretty rockin' white party every sailing, resort casual attire, and drinks and tips are included.\\n\\nAlso, Oceania might be a good fit - although they have 2 smoking areas (one on the pool deck, and one closed off room indoors). Specialty restaurants included (and the food on board is fabulous), beer and wine/champagne included at lunch and dinner, and no formal attire needed. Oh, and very few children.\", 'I agree with Celebrity. My spouse and I sail with them, usually in the Retreat, which covers most of your wants and don’t wants.', 'We’ve only been on two cruises. Both on RC. Both were charter cruises, so we were with a predictable crowd we had things in common with. No kids on either cruise. Main dining was seating at your leisure and we always sat at a 2 person table. The entertainments was very much geared for the specific charters we were on. We had an absolute blast on both cruises. Looking to do a ‘regular’ cruise in 2024 just to see what that’s like since we’ve discovered we really enjoy cruising. The charter cruises are a bit pricier depending on the theme of it. But, going with a charter cruise very much eliminates many of your ‘don’t wants’. Smoking was only allowed on one section of the main pool deck and one side deck thing on a lower deck. Casino smoking was off and on. Sometimes it was allowed sometimes not, I think it depended on where we were at any given time? Maybe? Unless you get the drink package you’re going to spend through the nose for any alcoholic beverages. I’m not a big drinker but the drink package was worth it to me for the ease of simply not having to think about what/ when/ how much, and keeping up with any tabs at all anywhere. Just NOT having to keep track of stuff was worth it to me. Also the drink package included soft drinks, energy drinks, and specialty coffees.', \"Given your list of preferences/demands, the non-premium lines are out .

Celebrity and HAL are other lines that do not cater to families.\\n\\nExpecting a non-smoking cruise is not realistic.

In areas prone to snow or rain, waterproof jackets, hats, gloves, and umbrellas are recommended.\\n\\nAround the globe, consider appropriate shoes and gear for the excursions you have planned and the terrain you’ll encounter. For instance, you may pack water shoes if hiking a waterfall or a headscarf or conservative dress for visiting museums, mosques, temples, and churches.\\n\\nSHIPBOARD\\n\\nThroughout the ship, casual resort wear, sundresses, shorts, polos, or button-downs are appropriate, paired with sandals, low heels, and loafers.

Woe this poor planet.\\', \\'In Austria most (but not all) restaurants will close for the evening of the 24th. On 25th and 26th only shops will be closed - restaurants, cafes and all touristic sights like museums will operate normally.\\\\n\\\\nPublic transport will have longer intervals, but still be pretty good.\\\\n\\\\nI would expect the same to be true for most European countries. Restaurants or touristic sights usually do not close on holidays.\\\\n\\\\nSo unless you want to go shopping, you will be fine everywhere.\\\\n\\\\nIf shopping on 26th is a must, I know that most stores in London will be open.\\', \"There\\'s a train from Prague to Vienna and Vienna is super lovely during Christmastime.  Eat some sachertorte!  \\\\n\\\\nThere are also some beautiful cities around Prague that are a train ride away. \\\\n\\\\nI also love the idea of Krakow - it\\'s a bit like how Prague was before it got super touristy, and still has some gorgeous Christmas markets.  Not sure what\\'s open over the holidays as Poland is a super Catholic country.\", \\'I agree with the sentiment but talking about it on a travel based sub without providing alternatives(like Vienna- a short train ride away!!) might not be welcome\\']', '[\\'You want to kayak. In March. In Colorado. And you want to visit vineyards. Those aren’t really winter activities. \\\\n\\\\nFly into Denver. Make reservations at Meow Wolf Convergence Station. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe visit the Museum of Science and Nature.\\\\n\\\\nYou could go visit New Belgium in Ft. Collins.\\', \">lakes/kayaking/water rafting/water related excursions\\\\n\\\\n>not really looking to do any crazy hikes, as it is a pretty big group\\\\n\\\\n>vineyards\\\\n\\\\nThose are not really March/April activities. March is still likely ski/snow/snowshoe season. Or it is the start of mud/snow season. Rafting season doesn\\'t start till May.\", \"Try Estes Park, just 90 minutes from Denver. It\\'s perfect for snow activities, has a cool downtown area for chill nights, and wine tasting options. You can also visit the Rocky Mountain National Park nearby.\", \\'Not Aspen with your driving distance limitations. And if it’s snowing on I-70 and/or Vail Pass…. Yeah don’t bother. That’s a totally separate trip out there. You will not be doing any lake or river stuff in  CO in March/April lmao\\', \\'Lots to do in Ft Collins and Estes Park\\', \\'Not listed, but the Olympics museum in Colorado Springs was pretty cool.  Ancient olympics, to modern day.  Some interactive items where you can virtual bobsled, archery.  Tons of memorabilia from Dan Jansens skates, a Bruce Jenner wheaties box, ancient medals, the Olympic torches, really enjoyed it.\\', \\'Snowmass / Glenwood Springs area could work. \\\\n\\\\nWe personally really like Estes Park\\', \\'You could spend a night at Mt Princeton Hot Springs and then drive from there over to Winter Park or Breck to do some snow tubing/ski resort/mountain town stuff. Hiking/water stuff is out for that time of year - it’ll still be too cold and there will be too much snow on the ground in the mountains.\\', \\'We have lots of breweries in Colorado, not many wineries. Do you like beer? Honestly, I don’t think early spring in Colorado is very compatible with your interests. Fort Collins will be greening up in April and there are lot of breweries and a cute downtown. Glenwood springs has hot springs and some non-skiing snow activities but depending on I-70 traffic and snow the drive from Denver may not be very fun\\', \\'Just stay in Texas\\', \\'Go to Indian Hot Springs in Idaho Springs! It’s also just a cute little town to stop in for a beer. But the hot springs are awesome. There is a large shared pool but then it’s separated into men/women underground caves. I felt absolutely primal.\\', \"A ton of weather variability in March and April, but if you\\'re going to the mountains expect snow and likely tricky driving conditions if you\\'re not used to it. As others have said you definitely won\\'t be doing any wineries (most of those are western slope anyway) or water activities. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'d echo Estes Park and add Granby/Grand Lake/Winter Park/Hot Sulphur Springs area. \\\\n\\\\nBreckenridge is a great choice IMO if you want ski town vibes without actually skiing: the main street is neat, there are lots of nearby snow activities like tubing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, and there are other cute towns and other ski resorts with activities very nearby for variety. Aspen is straight up annoying if you\\'re not wealthy (too far anyway), and I\\'d definitely give Vail a miss if you\\'re not skiing. Be advised that those non-skiing snow activities could be over by April though. Maybe Steamboat and Strawberry Hot Springs but that\\'s pushing your radius a bit and I think Breck is prettier anyway.\", \\'If you end up around Colorado Springs, head west and check out 11 Mile Canyon. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s a really cool drive along the Platte River, takes you inside the mountains with great camping and fishing.\\']', '[\\'On day 1, do you mean Leicester Square Christmas Market? If so, skip it and explore Covent Garden instead.\\', \\'If \"Day 5\" is actually 25 December then definitely make sure you have a reservation for Christmas dinner (lunch/afternoon).\\\\n\\\\nYou may find it hard to find a pub open in the evening that day though.  A traditional pub with a landlord may open for a couple of hours for drinks only around midday, but afterwards they will shut for them and their family to have Christmas dinner, or will only be open for Christmas dinner (with prior reservation).\\\\n\\\\nAlso bear in mind that even in central London public transport will be closed on 25 December with very few exceptions and taxis are likely to be harder to find and operating on higher pricing.\\', \\'that seems like a nicer time, thanks!\\', \\'We’re trying to find a Christmas dinner reservation that’s not more than £200 within 15 minute of where we’re staying and that’s been a little difficult since we’re staying in Mayfair\\']']\n",
