Do not trust 3rd party services.**\\n\\n___\\n\\n\\n**For the last few years we\\'ve been getting multiple posts a day on American Passport Questions. To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I\\'ve created this Megathread.**\\n\\n___\\n\\nTHE BEST ADVICE IS: \\n\\n* APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. \\n* ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT\\'S EXPIRATION DATE. \\n* PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. \\n* DO NOT WAIT TO CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY. \\n\\n\\n___\\n\\n**[The 2022 Thread Can Be Found Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/v2m73y/passport_questions_issues_megathread_2022/)**\\n\\n**[The Winter 2021 / Spring 2022 Passport Megathread can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ps3cvv/us_passport_questions_issues_megathread/).**\\n\\n**[The Spring/Summer 2021 Passport Megathread can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/nhe74a/passport_questions_issues_megathread_summer_2021/).**\\n___\\n\\n#American Passport Information \\n\\n## How to Apply\\n\\n[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).\\n\\nThere will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents & IDs you\\'ll need, etc.\\n\\n##Where to Apply\\n\\n[Then you\\'ll need to see which avenue you\\'ll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).\\n\\n[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).\\n\\nNOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. \\n\\n\\n##Processing Times Within the US\\nAs of October 2023, times have been extended.\\n\\n[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).\\n\\nNormal processing is around 8-11 weeks.\\n\\nExpedited processing is around 5-7 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)\\n\\nUrgent processing within 3 business days. And you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date if you\\'ve not applied before. If you have you can only call within 5 business days of your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.\\n\\nLife or Death/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.\\n\\nNOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.\\n\\nNOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel \"to the day\" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.\\n\\nNOTE: It can take up to 2 weeks before your status changes to \"In Process\".\\n\\n**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than stated times BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**\\n\\n**Many people are saying that both Normal and Expedited processing is taking weeks longer than the above-listed processing time.**\\n___\\n\\n#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US\\n\\n### What is the status of my application?\\n\\nCheck here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/\\n\\n### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?\\n\\nNo. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 2-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn\\'t mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. \\n\\nOnce they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren\\'t in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.\\n\\n### Can I get a same day passport.\\n\\nNot likely during covid since they aren\\'t taking walk in appointments.\\n\\n### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I don\\'t have my passport/it\\'s lost/it\\'s expired/whatever, HELP WHAT DO I DO?\\n\\nIn all honesty you are pretty much SOL. [It is almost impossible to get the Urgent/Life or Death/Emergency in-person appointments](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html). For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link. If you are trying to go that route you\\'ll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. \\n\\nNote that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.\\n\\nOtherwise you may be better off calling all your pre-booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now-not-happening-trip. \\n\\n### Can I switch my application from Regular Processing to Expedited? \\n\\nYes. Expedited service costs an additional $60. If you applied and have not received your passport, you may call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 and receive instructions on how request to expedite your passport. \\n\\nNOTE: It can take 20 days to fulfill this request.\\n\\nNOTE: This is just a request, sometimes it cannot be honored. Regular Passports are processed at a different facility than Expedited ones. So they need to FIND your application paperwork in order to be able to switch the processing. \\n\\n\\n### I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasn\\'t changed/its been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website.\\n\\nThere may be a problem. Try contacting the State Department/Passport Office, or reach out to your state State Representatives. They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system.\\n\\n### My \"Status\" on the website says \"Not Available\"\\n\\nIt can take up to 2-6 weeks for your status to change to In-Progress.\\n\\n### How do I find my State Representatives who can assist me?\\n\\n[This link will help you for your State House Represenative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) or [you can also try your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm). Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf. Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling.\\n\\n### Can I buy a flight that shows I\\'m leaving within 3 business days, get my passport, and then cancel the flight/Can I fake a family emergency? \\n\\nNo, you\\'ll need to provide proof of your emergency. \\n\\n### Can I buy a flight that shows I\\'m leaving in 2 weeks, book the Urgent in-person appointment that would be within 72 hours of that flight, get my passport, and then cancel the flight? \\n\\nYes, but given that those appointments are still supposed to be for urgent/emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reason.\\n\\nFor those doing these in-person appointment, you\\'ll get your passport within a few hours or a day or two from the appointment. They\\'ll factor in your urgency, what wiggle room you have, and the other needs to figure out what priority yours will be. But you will get it within 72 hours.\\n\\n### What about using a 3rd Party Rush/Expediting Service/Courier/Expeditor?\\n\\nDO NOT USE THESE!!!\\n\\nThere is no magical service (other than contacting your state\\'s house of representatives) that can get you your passport quicker than official channels. You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isn\\'t guaranteed or possible. As well as there are many outright scam companies out there. I would not recommend you give them your personal information. [See the official government info here on why you should not use these](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html).\\n\\n### I\\'m an American currently abroad and my passport recently expired. I need to quickly return to USA, can I travel on an expired passport?\\n\\nNot any longer this ended December 31st, 2021.\\n\\n## Other Questions\\n\\n### Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book?\\n\\nFor air travel, the airline won\\'t even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas. This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentation/visas. \\n\\nA passport card cannot be used for air travel.\\n\\n### Can I travel internationally by land without a passport?\\n\\nWe frequently get questions on this especially for the USA/Mexico border. Officially no, you actually do need a passport. Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport.\\n\\n### Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport?\\n\\nWe\\'d recommend hitting up /r/cruise as it may depend on your specific cruise. Some may not allow you on at all without a passport, others simply won\\'t let you do shore excursions if you don\\'t have a passport.\\n\\n### I have dual citizenship, can I travel on my other passport instead?\\n\\nWhile USA has no exit immigration, so you don\\'t need to show your passport to exit, you are required to enter the USA on your American passport. You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport. So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an Embassy/Consulate before you return, get your American passport before you go.\\n\\n\\n### What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card?\\n\\nCard is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry. Think Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Bermuda. You cannot use it for air travel.\\n\\nIf you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book.\\n\\n### Since US Embassies are processing passports faster (less than 6 weeks), how can I send my application there to be processed?\\n\\nYou can\\'t. Embassies only process passports for people in-person and in-country. \\n\\nAlso, if your travel is soon and you are headed back to the US, you\\'ll be given a limited-use Emergency Passport that can only be used to travel back to the US.\\n\\nSo the \"Why don\\'t I just fly to Mexico on my soon to be expiring passport and apply at the embassy there?\" idea only works if you are in Mexico for 6+ weeks and if you have a current valid passport to even enter Mexico (or insert whatever other US Embassy you were asking about.)\\n\\n### I\\'ve heard about \"6 Month Validity Rule\" what is it and what does it mean?\\n\\nSome countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry (or exit). This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country. Some countries do not have this requirement, some require it to be 3 months, etc.\\n\\nBut the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early. And so its best to renew it before that time.\\n\\n\\n### I lost my passport, reported it lost, and now just found the original one, can I travel on it?\\n\\nNo. Once reported lost/stolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel. You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you don\\'t accidentally bring it to the airport.\\n\\n### I lost my passport, but have a photo copy. Am I okay to travel?\\n\\nNO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n### I got part of my order but didn\\'t get my old passport/new passport/passport card/my ID documents?!?\\n\\nThey\\'ll come in separate shipments.\\n\\n\\n### I forgot my passport was in my maiden name/former name. Can I still use it for travel?\\n\\nYour ticket must match your passport name. \\n\\nNote: There may be issues if your vaccine card/info is in a different name than the passport/ticketed name, but use the COVID Megathread for that question. \\n\\n\\n### How can I get flight confirmation/book a flight if I don\\'t have my passport? \\n\\nUnless you are booking with a 3rd party agency that charges for every little change, pretty much all airlines allow you to book with nonsense numbers (all 1\\'s) and at a later time update your passport info, or even wait until check in, in-person to do so.\\n\\nMany people do not have passports when they book flights, or they lose their passport, or their passport expires. They are fully aware that until they check the passport day-of, the information might not be correct or valid.\\n\\n### Other FAQs from the source:\\n\\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/passport-help/faqs.html \\n\\n___\\n\\nOther fun governmental processes that are also heavily delayed are TSA Precheck, Global Entry, SENTRI, NEXUS, see this post from 5/17/23 for more info https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13k7b2p/global_entry_sentri_and_nexus_wait_times_from/\\n___\\n\\n# ONE KEY RULE:\\n\\nIf you are answering any question with timing of how long it took you to get your passport you MUST state when this happened.\\n\\n___\\n\\n**Lastly, the person who created this post /u/jadeoracle is NOT your personal passport problemsolver.** This post was created simply so we wouldn\\'t have 100 posts a day cluttering the rest of the sub.

       " 'chosen': '\\'As expected based on the last few years, the Late Feb through July passport rush has occurred. We are in the period where last minute Spring Break travelers are trying to get a passport or realized theirs is lost/missing/expired. Additionally, people trying to get ahead of summer travel are seeking passports.  **The passport agency has increased the processing times yesterday (the second time in 2 months).**  https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/politics/blinken-state-department-passport-delays/index.html \\\\n**Since most people don\\\\\\'t read the wall of text above (you should) the bottom line is without shipping it\\\\\\'ll likely take you between 2-5 months** to get your passport depending on which processing method you chose. Expect those that are in process currently to also have delays, and that the processing times likely will continue to increase. **So the times listed by the agency are NOT TO BE TRUSTED.** **Note that the \"Urgent\" in-person appointments are hard to come by. Yes, you only need proof of travel, usually a flight (a fully refundable one will work) within 14 days for people who\\\\\\'ve not applied yet (although some people are saying within 5 days if you had already applied) and that is the only other option available to most people.** However, those appointments are limited, do not allow walk ins, and you may need to fly to another location to get one. Do not assume you\\\\\\'ll be able to get an appointment, as this \"hack\" is known and everyone else is doing it, which results in the passport phone number to be a busy signal or dropping calls. **Lastly, most people\\\\\\'s Congressperson or Senator will not help until you are within 2 weeks of travel.**\\', \\'SPRING BREAK RUSH HAS STARTED. AS OF TODAY PROCESSING TIMES HAVE INCREADED BY WEEKS!!!!!\\', \\'I am at a passport facility, where they told us that there is an ongoing backlog of 80,000 - 100,000 passport renewals in the online system (only 500,000 people applied total!) and they are taking 50 extra appointments per day to process as many as possible. Definitely get an appointment ASAP if you can. The online renewal system seems like a disaster. edit: Walked out with my passport same day as my appointment\\', \\'Hi guys.Pls post an update when you get your passport.  It would motivate us who are waiting and get us a bit out of anxiety. We all need positives.\\', \\'I used to love Mozart. Now he will forever be associated with the online passport renewal system.\\', \\'This thread helped me get my passport on time (traveling **3/2**) so sharing my timeline here: **1/24**: submitted expedited renewal application via mail (travel.state.gov(https://travel.state.gov) at the time showed a 3-5 weeks timeframe for expedited renewals) **1/30**: application status updated to \"In process\" **2/17**: within 2 weeks of travel date. Called passport agency, got no help - was told that expedited renewal processes were now 5-7 weeks long. Contacted (phone+email) both my state senators and a congressman per Reddit\\\\\\'s advice. Attached proof of travel and the required release forms in every email. Congressman responded back to me within 8 hours via email telling me that passport was now approved. **2/18**: passport status changed to \"Shipped\" **2/22**: passport received (had paid for the 1-2 day return delivery) end to end: **29 days.**\\', \\'deleted\\', \"Just want to say, although I\\'ve been manning the passport thread here for years, I\\'ve not had to actually test out the clusterfuck of the process. Just got called by my parents, both just had their passports expired and need my help renewing them. SO...yep. Expect actual first hand experience/updates from me soon on this whole process.\", \\'5 days from travel update (applied 1/6 online with expedited processing. added expedited shipping later)...  2/26. At 11:30pm I saw that I could no longer update my contact/shipping information in the online system which was a huge glimmer of hope.  2/27.    \\\\nI call NPIC and get through at 8am PST after busy signals and dropped calls. After a couple of holds and extra checks, the customer service rep offers me an in-person appointment in Honolulu. I waffle for about 15 seconds and then she says, oops – it’s gone now. She is unable to give me any status update on my online application, but agrees that if I can’t update the contact info, it’s likely on its way but that she can’t say when it will arrive. She confirms that if I miss my Saturday flight, I need to have a new flight in order to get an in-person appointment which is highly annoying.  I send my congressional reps an update email after the call (I have been corresponding with them since last Tuesday). They respond saying that they will check on my online passport and look for appointments in LA and San Francisco.  I call NPIC again and get through at 11am. The lady goes puts me on hold so she check something else and returns with 3-4 appointments on Friday (the day before my flight leaves) in Seattle, the mecca for wayward passport applicants. I choose one (immediately! lol) and she tells me that I can have only one appointment at a time, so I need tell the congressional reps to stand down or I run the risk of losing the Seattle appointment if they get me one locally. I send them an email after the call.    \\\\n  My plan is book a refundable ticket to the passport agency and hope that my online passport arrives before I leave so I can cancel my appointment and flight. **Takeaways**: I think that something special does happen when you\\\\\\'re 5 days out from travel. During both of my calls, I was put on at least one additional hold and I heard one of the customer service reps reviewing my application submission date and expedited status to herself. I called a couple times when I was 8-12 days out and they would always tell me there was nothing available and to call back when I was five days out.  So don\\\\\\'t lose hope completely if you can\\\\\\'t get an in-person appointment when you\\\\\\'re less than 14 days out. When you\\\\\\'re 5 days out, keep calling. My plan was to repeatedly call throughout the day - luckily I got mine during my second call with NPIC. My congressional representatives weren\\\\\\'t able to get me an in-person appointment, but there\\\\\\'s a good chance they moved my online application along. Definitely reach out to them and send them a copy of your flight itinerary with that privacy form. I contacted mine at 12 days from travel and wish that I had started the process at 3 weeks from travel. Also try and be pleasant on the calls. I get how frustrating it is, but ranting and raving won\\\\\\'t help you. (I saved that for this thread. haha) Good luck everyone and safe travels. ETA. Wow - so get this. Both congressional offices sent me emails like 8 minutes after I posted this coming through with Friday appointments at my local (Los Angeles) passport agency. I\\\\\\'ve officially cancelled my Seattle appointment and heading over there as 5 miles away is much better than 900 miles. The congressional rep was super chill about it too - \"oh we always get appointments. When they couldn\\\\\\'t print yours, you were given an automatic in-person appt.\" I still can\\\\\\'t believe it. Moral of the story is GET THOSE CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES INVOLVED!\\', \\'**ONLINE RENEWAL W/ EXPEDITED PROCESSING** For those of you who have been waiting longer than expected and are traveling within the next two weeks (13 calendar days or less), I strongly recommend you contact your senator and/or representative ASAP as it can definitely get your application moving along quickly if it’s been stuck for whatever reason.  Here’s a timeline of how things are going for me. For reference, I live in NYC, applied 1/15/23 and will travel on 3/9/23. 1/15/23 11:35 PM (all times EST) - Applied for online renewal with expedited processing. Processing time when I applied was 3-5 weeks 1/23/23 3:33 AM - Status changed to Received 2/24/23 7:59 AM - Status still says “Received” so I call the NPIC’s 877 number at 7:59 AM to request an in person appointment for urgent travel service as I’m now 13 days away from travel on 3/9/23. Finally able to speak with rep after 15 mins of holding only to be told there are no appts available and they can’t look for appts for me until it is within 5 days before travel.  I then reach out to my Senator and Congresswoman/Representative via email, send in itinerary, passport application # and privacy request form and request assistance. Senator and Congresswoman’s offices both confirm receipt and open inquiries with passport agency the same day 2/26/23 2:30 PM - Status changed to “In Process” in online portal. At this point I can no longer update address or shipping speed (this is a very good indicator that your passport is almost ready to be shipped!) 2/27/23 4:17 PM - Senator’s office emails to let me know that passport agency has been alerted to “the urgent need” for my passport and that the agency will do its best to provide an update ASAP 2/27/23 ~6:15 PM - Status is still “In Process” but I see a Priority Mail package and tracking number show up in my Informed Delivery from “PASSPORT SERVICES/DOS TUCSON” in Tucson, AZ. Package is on its way later that evening 2/28/23 5:42 PM - Status changed to “Shipped” 3/2/23 by 9 PM - Scheduled delivery (phew!) UPDATE: 3/1/23 12:15 PM - Passport finally delivered a day ahead of schedule!! TOTAL wait time from applying to passport delivery - 6 weeks 3 days\\', \\'My timeline to date: * 1/9 - I submitted online renewal application with routine services (quoted 6-9 weeks for routine applications). Traveling 3/25.\\\\n* 1/10 - I received \"Your Passport Application Status – In Process\" email\\\\n* 1/13 - I received \"Your Passport Application Status – Received\" email (weird - I logged in a few days later and my status was \"in-process\")\\\\n* 3/8 - We\\\\\\'re now in the middle of week 8 and I start to get worried. came across a Reddit thread suggesting to contact both the senate (Diane Feinstein) and congressperson. Found their respective contact info on their websites and emailed my privacy release form at 1:30am PST.\\\\n* 3/8 - Surprisingly received same-day email reply from Feinstein\\\\\\'s office around 10am PST. Their reply included \"We can only submit requests to the US Passport Agency within 14 days of a constituent’s planned travels. Given this, however, we will make sure to submit your request for an expedited passport on 3/10 (this is my 14-day mark) and send you a confirmation once we’ve done so.\"\\\\n* 3/10 - I never received that aforementioned confirmation email so I followup with Feinstein\\\\\\'s office again that evening to check in on my passport status. No response.\\\\n* 3/13 - Followed up again at 9am PST, letting them know it is now 12 days until I fly out. I receive an email reply at 1pm PST confirming they initiated an inquiry on my behalf on 3/10. Informed me to wait 3-4 days before following up again.\\\\n* 3/16 - Followed up again after 3 days, letting them know that I am flying out the following weekend. No response.\\\\n* 3/17 - I called passport online support (855-865-7750) who then transferred me to the regular passport information center (877-487-2778). Wasted 3 hrs of my life for them to basically tell me they can\\\\\\'t really do anything until my travel is 5 days out. But they did say they have initiated an inquiry on my behalf to hopefully expedite the process. He also confirmed that if you can no longer change your address/upgrade shipping on the mytravel portal then that means \"you can no longer make further changes to your application since it is in the hands of an agent for processing, which is a good sign indicating your application is moving along\"\\\\n   * If you keep getting a busy tone or can\\\\\\'t get through to the passport information center (877-487-2778), **DEFINITELY call passport online support (855-865-7750)** \\\\\\\\- it\\\\\\'ll add another 1-1.5 hr to your overall wait time but they can directly transfer your call so you\\\\\\'re placed in the queue.\\\\n   * Found this Reddit hack(https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online_apps_look_at_the_network_traffic_to_get/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) later that evening where I noticed I\\\\\\'m in \"Fulfillment\" but not sure how long I\\\\\\'ve been in this stage.\\\\n* 3/20\\\\n   * 6am PST - I called 877-487-2778 (on hold for 1 hr) and the guy who assisted me was able to look at my application number and see that I was in the \"printing\" phase, but he could not give me any information other than \"it will likely ship within the next few days, but with standard shipping that that would mean you may not receive your passport until the day of your flight (or later).\" He recommends I schedule an in-person appointment for same-day pickup. He transfers me to the regular passport services number (on hold for 2 hrs) - the lady I speak with says there\\\\\\'s no in-person appointments available across the nation but says not to give up hope since my application is making progress. Both phone agents said they put a note in my application to hopefully expedite the service. My stomach is in knots at this point.\\\\n   * 10:45am PST - I also emailed Feinstein\\\\\\'s office again letting them know it is now 5 days before I fly out. I receive an email reply at 12:15pm PST (quickest reply so far) that they received the following response from US Passport services on 3/17: \"The passport was completed and should go out in today’s mail.\"\\\\n* 3/21 - I reply back to clarify whether my passport was supposed to go out in 3/17 or 3/20\\\\\\'s mail since I did not receive a tracking number or official correspondence. No response.\\\\n* 3/22\\\\n   * 7:23am PST - I get a USPS Informed Delivery email and it shows I am expecting a package from PASSPORT SERVICES/DPO TUCSON with a tracking number stating estimated delivery tomorrow night. I checked mytravel portal and it still showed my status as \"in-process.\"\\\\n   * 1:30PM PST - I received \"Your Passport Application Status – Shipped\" email.\\\\n   * 3:30PM PST - I received a courtesy phone call from the passport agency (likely due to all the inquiries initiated on my behalf from the phone agents/Feinstein\\\\\\'s office) who told me my passport has shipped and I should receive it by this weekend. She was reciting the first few digits of the tracking number on my application, which was different than the one I got from USPS Informed Delivery. I started to panic a bit because the last thing I need is to be sent someone else\\\\\\'s passport!!\\\\n      * I logged into mytravel -> clicked on my application number -> clicked on hyperlinked tracking number and got an error page. After dissecting the mytravel tracking number, I noticed that mine had a bunch of unnecessary digits before the actual USPS tracking number. For example: My actual USPS tracking number started with 920559XXXXXXXX. On mytravel website, the tracking number they provided was 420(my zip code)0000**920559XXXXXXXX**. If you come across the same issue, your USPS tracking should be the string of digits after the 0000.\\\\n* 3/23 - Supposed to have passport delivered by the evening. I will update this once I have the physical passport in my hands. Please pray for me. \\\\n   * **UPDATE - tracking says delivered 1:41PM PST, and I got to physically hold it in my hands when I got home from work at 6:30PM PST :\\\\\\')** This entire ordeal has honestly got me sick to my stomach and I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy! Best of luck to you all 🙏🏻\\', \\'Just cancelled our whole trip.  Total clusterf\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*.  Here\\\\\\'s my story: Travel to Japan planned for 4/9/23 for my entire family.  Visit the passport-office in person on 2/15/23 - this was cutting it a little close, but we paid for expedited service and were told at the time to expect 5-7 week turnaround (7 weeks would still be in time for travel). Didn\\\\\\'t really think about it again until late March.  Checked status online two weeks ago and realized two things: (1) the turnaround time had changed to 7-9 weeks, and (2) the turnaround time is based on when the passports were \\\\\\\\*received\\\\\\\\* not the visit to the office.  Our passports were received 2/22/23 a week after our visit.   Started getting nervous and calling the passport office last week and quickly realized we were in trouble.  Didn\\\\\\'t get through until 3/29/23 and was able to make a note indicating urgent travel.  Called several more times and realized that was the only thing they could do. Contacted my senator\\\\\\'s office on Friday (3/31/23) and spoke to a human on Monday and Tuesday but it sounded like their casework group was pretty overwhelmed with passport help requests and I don\\\\\\'t think they reached-out to the passport office until Tuesday or Wednesday (4/4-4/5). Starting calling the passport office at 5am PST every day this week to get an emergency appointment but none were available anywhere closer than El Paso (we\\\\\\'re in San Diego - that\\\\\\'s a 10+ hour drive).   On Thursday (4/6) three days before our trip the status on the passport website still said \"in process\" and I hadn\\\\\\'t seen any movement at all.  Still no appointments available.  I started cancelling our flights and hotel reservations.  Family is pretty heartbroken - this is going to cost us something like $10K to reschedule. Wait for it... Last night (4/7) I check the passport website and the status has changed to **shipped 😫**!  Tracking info is available and expected delivery is Monday 4/10, **one day after our flights**.  I suppose there\\\\\\'s a chance they\\\\\\'ll get delivered today, but now it\\\\\\'s too late, everything is cancelled anyway.  What a mess.\\', \"Read below for a detailed saga of my passport application. I submitted my online application for renewal on 1/6 with expedited processing, and submitted my preschooler’s first-time application in-person on 1/13 with expedited processing. Hers came in the mail on 2/9. We have an international flight booked for 3/4.     **Mon 1/9**    Received notice that my online Passport Application Number XXXXXX is being reviewed by US Dept State employee with an expedited processing time of 3-5 weeks. \\\\n**Mon 2/20**     Federal Holiday. MyTravelGov shows that passport is in “In Process Status” with under 2 weeks until international travel. \\\\n**Tues 2/21**     Attempted to call National Passport Information Center at 5am PST to make an Urgent Travel Service appointment since my flight was less than 14 days, but got a busy signal for 5 hours. Finally spoke to a representative at 10:30am PST after being put in the 45 minute wait queue for online passport applications (the wait queue for in-person applications was 4 minutes). Spoke to 3 different people and was told that in-person Urgent Travel appointments for online applicants could only be scheduled within 5 days of travel.  They noted my travel date. I went on the MyTravelGov portal to update my shipping to expedited on the guidance of one of the representatives.     10:00am. First contact with the offices of Senators Feinstein and Padilla, and Representative Ted Lieu for assistance – I emailed them their privacy forms, my flight information, passport application number, and application submission date at. Followed up with phone calls where I left messages for Padilla and Lieu and actually spoke to a person at Feinstein’s office. She told me she had 30 people in the same boat and was going to check on the status of my application. Got an email from Lieu’s office at 2:30pm saying they were going to investigate. (Never heard from Padilla’s office) \\\\n**Wed 2/22**     Received 2 forwarded emails (at 1:18pm and 2:06pm) from the National Passport Information Center, courtesy of Rep. Lieu’s office. Application is being processed at the New Orleans Passport Agency (they took 2/21 off for Mardi Gras) and the Rep’s office has alerted the agency of the urgent need. I thanked the congressional staff member and let them know of the 5-day stipulation for in-person appointments and he said that he will be notified when passport is printed before it is shipped, that he would get me an in-person appointment if needed, and that he is monitoring my file.     Tried to check my application to see if I could change my address (on the hunch that if you are unable to do so, your passport is in its final stages and ready to ship), but the site was so buggy and I could never get the One Time Password. Called the passport website tech support (also someone in here said that they think that might have done something to speed the process along haha), and they helped me trouble shoot (use Chrome in an incognito window, use a different browser, delete cookies, etc.). Tech person confirmed that yes, when you are unable to modify your shipping, passport is ready to ship out.  \\\\n**Thurs 2/23**     Site is still really buggy. Can’t get on to check my status. Call NPIC – not giving me an appointment. No change in status. Made childcare arrangements with family in case I had to fly across the country the following week for an in-person appointment. \\\\n**Fri 2/24**     At 2pm Senator’s office said they’re trying to get me an appointment in San Francisco and to hold on tight. I take a nap and dream that I have an appointment. Wake up, no update from Senator. No change in online status. \\\\n**Sat 2/25**     No change in online status. \\\\n**Sun 2/26**     Draft emails to send to my congressional representatives while I’m on hold with the NPIC on Monday at 5am PST. Decide to check online status because I’m a masochist. At 11:39pm instead of being able to change my passport address I get the magic “Thank you for your online passport book/card renewal application.” Proceed to freak the fuck out.  \\\\n**Mon 2/27**     Officially at the 5 days before travel mark.     6:43am. (slept through my 5am alarm :/) Call NPIC after 2 rounds of busy signals. Get through at 8am. After a couple of holds and extra checks, she offers me an in-person appointment in Honolulu. I waffle a bit and then she says, oops – it’s gone now. She is unable to give me any status update on my online application but agrees that if I can’t update the contact info, it’s likely on its way but that she can’t say when it will arrive. She confirms that if I miss my Saturday flight, I need to have a new flight in order to get an in-person appointment which is highly annoying. But there are no appointments anywhere.     8:37am. I send congressional reps an email begging for help. They both respond with 2 hours saying they will check on online passport and look for appointments in LA and San Francisco.     9:32am. I call NPIC again after 11 rounds of busy signals. Get through at 11am. The lady goes puts me on hold so she can check something else and returns with several appointments on Friday 3/3 (the day before my flight leaves) in Seattle, the mecca for wayward passport applicants. I choose one and she tells me that I can have only one appointment at a time, so to tell the congressional reps to stand down or I run the risk of losing the Seattle appointment if they get me one.     11:30am. I send an update to the congressional reps telling them to focus on pushing the online application through and that I have an in-person appointment. My plan is to book a refundable ticket to Seattle and hope that my passport arrives in time so I can cancel my appointment and flight.     2:14pm. I receive an email from my Rep’s office saying that my passport will not be processed in time at New Orleans, so he’s booked a 7:30am appointment for me the day before my flight at the Los Angeles agency. 6 miles away is much better than 900 miles away so I gratefully cancel the Seattle appointment.    \\\\n  \\\\n2:48pm. My Senator’s office also has an appointment for me at Los Angeles (I cancel that one since I already have one from the Rep.). \\\\n**Tues 2/28**     8:50am.

Flying to UK on 3/10.  1/9 - applied online expedited  1/10 - application turned In Process  2/7 - started getting worried, so contacted my rep, Maria Salazar’s office, by email. Signed the release form.  2/14 - rep’s office gives me a call. Says not to worry, there is processing backlog, but they will try to expedite my case. Told me I might need to schedule an appt in-person, and to just wait in the meantime for their call/email.  2/21 - my application status changes to “check status here” link. Link takes me to mailed application check, where my status is In Process, application received on 2/21 and it might take 5-7 weeks to process. I start freaking out about what’s going on, as I applied online in Jan. Call the rep’s office again, got the same answer, there is backlog but don’t panic yet.  2/27 am - call the NCIP hotline, spend an hour on hold to be told they can’t see my status as their system is down, and to call back on 3/3 to try to get an in-person appt. Call the rep’s office again, being forceful to get the status and what’s actually getting done to get my case expedited.  2/27 pm - check my status online and it turned to shipped.  2/28 - passport received.  In the process, I also reached out to the state senators, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott. No response at all from Rubio, Scott got back to me the next day with actual status, but by that time my passport already shipped. Moral of the story is, get your representative and senators involved! Keep calling and talking with whoever responds to you! I believe my rep actually made a difference, so I’m sending her flowers as I’m so happy I get to go and don’t have to cancel expensive plans. So there is hope!\\', \\'I will update this as I get info: Mine (online submission): •12/28/23 - hit submit online, no expedited services, (16 weeks to travel; given 6-9 week turn around at that time) 12/29/23 - Moved to In Process 3/3/23 - finished 9 weeks and still in process 3/6/23 - upgraded to expedited shipping online 3/6/23 - emailed Senator asking to check status -  they made an inquiry to the National Passport Information Center, the response was that they were \"notifying the Washington Passport Agency\" - whatever that means 3/10/23 - finished 10 weeks and still in process/can still update address info 3/16/23 - today is the end of week 11; tomorrow the start of week 12.

Not sure who to send it to...  waiting for the senate office to respond. 3/15/23 - Still in process.  Called the NPIC and was able to reach a human in short order (seriously, hit \"1\" for call back, got a message that they were unable to call back but then clicked over to a human).  Chatted with the agent about **expediting services, was told that would add 27 BUSINESS days IF APPROVED**; since our trip is in about a month AND we have already waited almost 9 weeks, not doing it (**THIS IS EXTORTION**).  Was told if we do not have it in hand by April 7 (which would be week 12), to call and make an appointment.  But would need a copy of the birth certificate (more money) in the event my in person appointment cannot contact the facility that is processing (Charleston, which does not have a customer counter).  I did purchase the expedited shipping, just to feel better that it is not delayed because of shipping. 3/16/23 - This is the last day of week 9, tomorrow will be the start of week 10. 3/20/23 - Emailed senator for clarification on expediting, received a reply (this was was the Charleston Passport Agency sent to the senator\\\\\\'s caseworker) \"Your inquiry has been received.

After completing my name change I submitted for a new passport at the end of January 2023. I originally selected routine processing (7-9 weeks) as my husband and I did not have any out-of-country travel plans at the time. Later, however, we booked a trip to Cancun, Mexico (departure: 4/29/23) to celebrate our 1 year anniversary.**My timeline/advice as follows:** 1. **2/2/23** \\\\\\\\- Passport received by U.S. Department of State (\\\\\\\\~12 weeks prior to travel date); passport check of $130 was also cashed around this time.\\\\n2. **4/1/23** \\\\\\\\- I contacted the passport agency (877#) who recommended and sent me an email to submit my contact and credit card information for \"Expedited Service Upgrade Request\", I submitted my information same day >4/1/23 - I received an automatic reply that stated \"This is a request. The passport agency will do its best to accommodate your request but cannot guarantee it. If the agency accepts your request, your credit card may be charged and the processing time will be **up to 27 business days**, not including federal holidays, from the time you send the request.  \\\\n>  \\\\n>Another part of the automatic reply included \"We have received your request to upgrade your passport application and/or change of mailing address. We are processing requests based on date of receipt on a first-in-first-out basis. It **may take 72 hours or more** for us to process your request. Please do not submit duplicate requests. If we have any questions or concerns regarding your request, we will contact you.\"  \\\\n>  \\\\n>**BOTTOM LINE: I NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE OR UPGRADE TO MY PASSPORT** 1. **4/11/23** \\\\\\\\- I contacted the passport agency (877#) and spoke to a \"passport specialist\" this time, who stated by phone that HE sent an \"urgent processing email request\". They also attempted to get me set up with a \"passport agency appointment\" in Atalanta, GA that MIGHT be able to print an on-site passport but were unable to tell me the agency\\\\\\'s hours and if this could even be guaranteed (I declined considering the uncertainty esp. given this would be a 7 hour round trip for me and time off work due to availability only M-F) >**BOTTOM LINE: the email did nothing, my passport status never changed; still \"in process\". Overall, I found the 877# to be extremely unhelpful, experienced long wait times (45 min - 1 hour) to receive different advice every time I called.** 1. **4/17/23 (\\\\\\\\~2 weeks from travel date)** \\\\\\\\- after reading the above pasted Reddit post, I contacted my local (TN) state representative office (OR you can contact your state Senator\\\\\\'s office) around \\\\\\\\~9 AM and spoke with a representative of her office directly. I explained my situation and the state representative\\\\\\'s office had me complete an online \"Digital Privacy Release Form\" which included personal information, contact information, passport locator #, explanation of your situation and they had me include an attachment of my travel itinerary (flight info and resort reservation booking)\\\\n2. **4/17/23** \\\\\\\\- My state representative office contacted them **the SAME DAY** via email to request my passport be expedited >The passport agency responded to them **THE SAME DAY** with part of the response stating \"Given your constituent\\\\\\'s upcoming travel date, I am notifying the Buffalo Passport Agency. They may reach out to you with further updates\" (I know this because they sent a printed copy of emailed conversation along with my updated passport) 1. **4/19/23** \\\\\\\\- I was contacted directly via phone by the U.S. Department of State that my passport was being worked on that day would be mailed on Thursday or Friday (4/20-4/21/23)\\\\n2. **4/22/23 (1 week from travel date, \\\\\\\\~11 weeks total processing time)** \\\\\\\\- I received my passport in the mail!! I was never charged for expedited processing - likely because the agency never reviewed my email sent on 4/1/23. Posting this in hopes that it helps someone else!

We plan to periodically reopen the service to new customers in a limited release before a full release later this year.Since last August, over 500,000 customers have successfully submitted an application online. Thank you for volunteering and testing our service during this limited release. We are reviewing survey feedback to continually improve the experience of renewing online.If you created your MyTravelGov account before 1 p.m. on February 7, follow the steps on this page to renew online. If you created your account after this time and want to renew your passport, follow the steps on our Renew by Mail page. I\\\\\\'ve been suspecting that there are problems with the Online Renewal setup, the shutdown sort of confirmed it.  I also had no idea it was a beta program, had I known I would have gone with mailing it in.  At that time the expedited was 3-5 weeks, I also called to confirmed that was the case, not just old data on the website. I submitted my renewal online almost 3 months ago (expedited+express shipping) with a Feb 2 travel date, it sat in \"received\" status for a month before updated to \"processing\" where it still sits.  I\\\\\\'ve called numerous times starting 2 weeks before my original travel date, never received anything helpful; they can only tell me it was being process, if there was any issues they would have contacted me (I received none), also that online applications are farmed out to various agencies so the processing time aren\\\\\\'t the same. On January 31 an agent told me I could go in person the next day but wouldn\\\\\\'t say if I\\\\\\'d have to pay the fees again (what?), also informed me that the closest agency to me with available appointments was in Chicago (I\\\\\\'m in NY).  I wasn\\\\\\'t about to fly to Chicago the next day, return home than head back to the airport again (my flight was 1;30am so I\\\\\\'d have to check-in late evening on Feb 1). I ended up rescheduling the flight for March 15, thinking surly I\\\\\\'d have my passport by then, now I\"m not so sure.  When I called last night the agent wouldn\\\\\\'t even take my application #, asked for my travel date, said they can\\\\\\'t do anything until 14 day prior to departure before hanging up on me. Now reading on this sub that there aren\\\\\\'t any appointments available anywhere currently, I\\\\\\'m thinking I should follow the suggestion on this sub, contact my congressman now instead of waiting another week only to find out they can\\\\\\'t even get me an appointment.\\', \\'Success!

I really started freaking out on 2/28 because I saw articles being posted about the backlog and other reddit posts saying how people never got their passport. I was so fearful of running into a situation where we\\\\\\'d have to make an in-person appt right before our flight and somewhere far... I work Mon-Fri 8a-6p so it was stressing me out. I\\\\\\'m glad it all worked out in the end!\\', \\'After a very anxiety-ridden past few weeks, I FINALLY GOT MY PASSPORT!!

Paid for expedited processing form the start. 02/06 - Received an email notification that my passport application was updated to \"In Process.\" Figured things were going according to the specified timeline. 02/28 - Started to get nervous, added on express shipping. 03/06 - Started getting very nervous. Called the passport support number (1-877-487-2778) - had to try a couple of times to get around \"high call volume\" but I actually did get through, \\\\\\\\~45 minute wait. The guy I talked to said there wasn\\\\\\'t anything he could do except maybe send a reminder to the staff working on my application. He told me if I don\\\\\\'t receive my passport by 3/15, I should call again, and they would try to make an appointment for me at a passport agency in SF. (Reading the comments here, I don\\\\\\'t know if that would have actually been true -- it seems appointments are very, very booked up) 03/07 - Per recommendations on this thread, started reaching out my state representatives and senator. The office of Senator Dianne Feinstein has a page specifically about passport help here(https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/submit-casework)!  03/08 - In <24 hours, received a response from office of Senator that they initiated an inquiry with the agency for me! Also got a response from office of my Congressman, sent privacy release forms, and they submitted an urgent request for me as well. No change in my application status online, but felt hopeful. Note I was 2 weeks from travel at this point (I don\\\\\\'t think your representative can initiate urgent inquiries like this if you are further out than that) 03/09 - Received a response from both caseworkers from Senator & Congressman. Congressman caseworker had located my application (#95 = Minneapolis) and sent an alert of my urgent travel. Senator caseworker forwarded me a response from the Pasport Center saying they would attempt to pull my case to their \"local physical queue,\" which would take 24-72 hours. Still no change in application process online, but I could no longer change my address, which is a good sign!! 3/10 - Senator caseworker said my passport was shipped and gave me a tracking number!!! 3/11- The passport was delivered and is in my hands!!! RELIEF The office of Senator Dianne Feinstein really knows what they\\\\\\'re doing. I basically got my passport within 4 days of reaching out to them. Feeling very grateful for that!!!

My status on the portal still says “Received”. I call NPIC and the agent says that on their end it is “In Processing.” She says she’ll note my travel date to move my application to the top of the queue, and that changing my processing to expedited won’t do much for me. At least, I pay for upgraded shipping. At this point, I keep calling for the next few days with little success. Discover the network thread and my status on that end is “Adjudication.” The agency opens at 8 am EST and I highly recommend getting to the automated message by 7:59 and working through the steps, so you can enter the queue right at 8 am as it opens. After you get past the first caller, they will redirect you and there is an additional queue to wait in. Every second after 8 am counts against you. * 3/9/23 - Contact my congressman and senator’s offices and fill out privacy forms. Only one office gets back to me within 24 hours saying they sent a notice to NPIC and to keep them updated for any changes.\\\\n* 3/10 - 3/14 - No major changes except lots of anxiety.\\\\n* 3/15/23 - I finally just upgrade to expedited processing anyway for the $60.

Begin to panic. Tried calling the 1-877 number but got hung up on numerous times. Then found this Reddit thread and figured out what was going on. Thank God for this Reddit thread!  Did the F12 trick and found I was marked \"Exception\" **3/14** Tried the 1-877 but for tech and asked to get transferred to the online applications. Stayed on hold for ... , wait for it .... , 7 HOURS! I never want to hear that Mozart piece again. Finally spoke with someone (actual human being) but since it was getting close to 11:00PM ET (technically they close at 10PM ET but I stayed on) the call automatically ended right at 11:00PM. Only got to talk with someone for a few minutes then click disconnected. **3/15** Reached out online to my Congressional Rep Office. Filled out online form and submitted. As a maritime crew member I need a passport for work. I also had to submit proof of travel and my employment verification. **3/16** Called Congressional Rep Office to follow up. Informed I was at the top of the list of passport inquiries. They had a lot of passport inquiries. **3/17** Got email from Congressional Rep Office with a response from the NPIC that they located my application in Dallas, TX. They marked my application \"Urgent\" **3/18** Online application status finally moved to \"In Progress\" **3/20** Checked F12 online status and it said \"Fulfillment\". Knew from this thread that it was now going to print and then shipping. **3/22** Got email from online website notifying me that passport has been shipped. **3/23** Received passport in the mail. Passport in hand. **Key Takeaways:** ***GET CONGRESSIONAL REPS or SENATORS INVOLVED***. It\\\\\\'s been said that some Congressional Reps or Senators Offices will not get involved until the 14 day mark before travel. I reached out at 3.5 weeks figuring it would allow for some wiggle room and I absolutely need it for work. My Congressional Rep Office never said that to me and they definitely moved it along. Without them nothing would have happened. Also I think because I need my passport for work purposes (and not vacation) it was pushed through the process (9 days from contacting Congressional Rep to passport in hand). Good luck Everyone!\\', \"Sharing my very fast timeline to give people hope.

I spent the last 10 days stalking this thread and reading every story and benefitting from the experiences and stories shared here. So I\\'m giving a lot of details because I took so many notes for myself. **TL;DR.** Applied expedited **3/27**, Passport in hand **5/11**, Travel **5/15**.  **Advice**: Contact your congressional representative 10-14 days before travel, ask nicely for help, and wait. Know that nothing will likely happen until 3-5 days out from travel. Passport locator: 42 **3/22/23:** Applied in-person for my new passport with expedited processing (at the time, published wait times were 5-7 weeks). Travel was 7.5 weeks out on 5/15. **3/27/23:** Application was received. **5/1/23:** Learned my lesson and called the passport information center right at 5am PST, was told they would flag my application with my travel date (5/15). I also requested 1-2 shipping and provided my credit card information. Was told if I still didn\\'t have passport I could call to try to schedule in-person appointment at agency 5 business days prior to travel. **5/2/23:** Learned my lesson and called passport information center right at 5am PST. Was told they would flag my application with my travel date (5/15). I also requested 1-2 shipping and provided my credit card information. I asked about any other options, and the agent said if I still didn\\'t have passport 5 business days before travel I could call to try to schedule in-person appointment at agency. **5/6/23:** Called immediately at 7am PST to try again for an appointment. Used travel date of 5/12 (would book a refundable ticket if appointment available) No agency appointments anywhere in the country. **5/8/23:** Called immediately at 5am PST to try again for appointment. After 90 minute hold, was told there were not appointments anywhere in the country.  **5/8/23:** Contacted my congressional representative via their site and attached my original flight and travel info. Also contacted Senator Alex Padilla via his website. (Both have simple forms for requesting help with federal agencies, and I found them thanks to this thread!) I got canned responses from both that they would investigate further. **5/9/23:** Was up early due to insomnia so called again at 5am. This agent said she has to check each agency location individually. She checked 5 western US offices and there was 1 appointment was in Seattle on my date of travel (I\\'m in Southern California). I tried to claim it, just in case, but it was gone before she could select it for me. 10am Heard back from my congressman\\'s office staff that they submitted a ticket to the Department of State on my behalf, but that there was nothing else they could do and they would let me know when they had an update 3pm Got an email from congressional office staff that my passport was approved (!!) and would be processed soon. Still concerned about it arriving by 5/12 for my travel. **5/10/23:**  Checked Passport status site, passport status showed as shipped! When I clicked on UPS there was a label created but not mailed yet. **5/11/23:** Woke up to find that shipping information was updated overnight. My passport was delivered to my hands before 12pm.\", \\'I had to come on here and give my personal experience because I was on here for so much support from you guys. Thank you!!!

In process on website on 03/30/2023. \\\\nChecked on 05/19/2023 still in process.  Came on here and decided to call the National Passport Information Center on 05/23/2023.  Waited on the phone 3.5 hours. I was told they could put urgent travel and paid for 1-2 day mailing option via phone.  05/24/2023 decided to email Texas Senator- John Cornyn- he had a form online to sign and fill out and email to his office. I got the information to do this from these beautiful people (Reddit posts).  -later that day I received an email stating they would reach out to the passport agency and requested I wait 10 days to hear back. If my travel day was less than 10 days they requested I reach out to the national passport information center. (12 days from departure)  -read to contact my Locator directly. Locator 42- (504) 412-2699. I did this several times with no response and not able to leave voice message.  05/30/2023 decided to go ahead an email the Senator for a reply and called the locator number again and was able to leave a message this time.  -earlier today I got an email from Senator Cornyn, the passport was approved and would be arriving on 06/02/2023. Four days before departure!

But our young son needed a new passport. June 7 - Made an appointment and applied at the post office. Expedited processing and shipping both ways. June 9 - Check cashed, and In Process June 10-July 17 - Always “In Process”  July 18 - Randomly for a whole day the status changed to “Not Available”. I have read completely anecdotally (do not rely on this) that this can happen just as your application is changing statuses, so I had hope!  July 19 - Status changed to APPROVED!!!  July 20 - Status changed to “shipped” with a tracking number, but apparently it actually shipped on the 19th  July 21 - PASSPORT IN HAND!! We got the passport exactly two weeks before our travel date, so I had not started the process of contacting the congressman or calling any of the passport numbers yet.  Door to door was just over 6 weeks. I also believe that adding the Expediting the shipping as well absolutely speeds things up, because we have a neighbor that applied a the post office a couple of days before we did (expedited processing but NOT shipping) and their passport still hasnt been approved, but obviously that is just a random data point.  \\\\nGood luck to all of you!!!\\', \\'Wanted to give people who read all these panic posts and  \"expedited priority mail\" some hope and peace for their own approval.

Will call the congress reps. On Tuesday will drive to my nearest passport agency and try to charm/beg my way inside while also calling passport hotline.  I estimate my chances as a 35% chance of being on that plane on 3/4. Has anyone not got their passport in time? If I miss my 3/4 plane trip, do I become “less urgent”?

At the time I get quoted with 3-5 weeks so I think it’s surely enough time before my travel date of 3/19. (Oh, boy) **1/25** \\\\\\\\- Status on MyTravelGov says passport is received. **2/1** \\\\\\\\- I get the “Received” status email. It still quotes 3-5 weeks for expedited applications.I check MyTravelGov every other week but the website is down most of the time. **3/3** \\\\\\\\- It’s now past 5 weeks since my passport was received, so past the quoted estimate. I call the passport help line and after a 6 hour hold (I went to a yoga class in between while listening to Eine Klein Nachtmusik ifykyk) the rep doesn’t give me any helpful information and just tells me to call back when I’m 5 days away from travel. **3/6** \\\\\\\\- I try the passport help line again and this time after 5 hours I get someone who’s more helpful. He tells me that the application is in processing (MyTravelGov still says received) in a facility in Minneapolis and since it was past the committed date he would send the agency a message. He also tells me to call back 5 days before travel. **3/10** \\\\\\\\- Called the passport help line again and the rep this time was so mean. I tried to ask about the likelihood of getting an in-person appointment and they were very rude to me. Panic starts to seep in. I check the internet for comfort and find this Reddit post. Following the instructions, I reach out to my senator and state rep. I call one more time, this time begging the first rep not to transfer me to the 5 hour hold for online renewals and asking him if he could look at appointment slots for me, even if he couldn’t book it, just to give me a sense of availability. He expresses sympathy about the long wait time but can’t help me. Despair starts to settle. **3/13** \\\\\\\\- Finally officially 5 business days before travel date. I wake up and call at 4:59AM and am put on hold until 9AM. The rep tells me there are no appointments available. I’m so upset I forget to ask her to clarify if she meant in California or the entire US. I tell her it’s past the commitment date (they like using that word) and she says she’ll flag it with the agency but that’s all she can do. I pin all my hopes on the senator coming through and send a follow up email. I check Reddit again and find this thread about the network traffic status(https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online_apps_look_at_the_network_traffic_to_get/). I try it and it shows “Exception.” **3/13 11:28 AM** \\\\\\\\- I get an email saying my passport application status has moved to “In Process”! I try the network traffic trick and it says “Fulfillment.” Starting to feel hopeful for the first time! **3/13 2PM** \\\\\\\\- I call the passport line again just to see if I can get an in-person appointment for backup and the rep tells me she doesn’t have any slots in San Francisco, Los Angeles, or San Diego, only a slot in Seattle for 9AM the next day. I decide to bet on the online application pulling through. **3/13 4:21PM** \\\\\\\\- A staff member from Dianne Feinstein\\'s office responds confirming they have initiated an inquiry with the agency on my behalf and will notify me as soon as they receive an update. **3/14 9:59AM** \\\\\\\\- The senator’s office gets back to me and says the passport is complete! They give me the USPS tracking number. It’s being shipped from Tucson. **3/14 2:53PM** \\\\\\\\- I get the “Your Passport Application Status - Shipped” email! **3/16** \\\\\\\\- Passport in hand. HOORAY! **3/21** \\\\\\\\- Travel date!! **Takeaways**: Don’t bet on getting an in-person appointment if you’re in California.

Now I’m wondering if I can get a refund of the expedited passport fee since it was outside the commitment date…\", \\'Hi all! Since this thread helped me so much I wanted to add my nightmare of a passport renewal experience. I went online to renew on 1/30 for a travel plan 3/19 with expedited shipping and processing. At the time it said 3-5 weeks for processing and I knew this was still cutting it close, as I was worried that the passport would be delayed or wouldn\\\\\\'t come on time. I called and the passport lady at the time ensured me that I should be good for my trip, as some people were receiving their passports earlier. She said to call 14 days out from my trip if I hadn\\\\\\'t received it yet to book an in-person appointment.  1/30 - Received 1/31- In Process (I took at this as a good sign it\\\\\\'d be processed soon.)  3/1 - Panic starts to set it. I start checking my online portal every day to see if anything has changed. Still in Progress.  3/5 - I called the passport agency to book an in-person appointment as I was 14 days out. Waiting on 1.5 hour hold for online renewal for the passport assistant to tell me I needed to call 5 days out for an appointment. I thought maybe he was wrong so I called and waited on hold for someone to tell me I couldn\\\\\\'t get an appointment until 5 days out. 3/10 - Turned to the internet for help. Found this INCREDIBLE reddit thread and saw that a lot of people contacted their local congressman and woman as well as senators. I was a bit desperate so I contacted both representatives from MA through email and phone. Heard back 2 days later and filled out their privacy form. They let me know they\\\\\\'d get back to me.  3/14 - Called early to try and get an in-person appointment. Spent 2 and half hours on the phone to get told no available appointments. The woman told me to call again and see if any spots open up. I repeat this cycle 3 times and no one can give me an appointment. I can\\\\\\'t even log into the travel.gov(https://travel.gov) website to get updates. I\\\\\\'m breaking down, crying, and trying to be polite to a very rude passport guy.  I\\\\\\'m thinking of all the money I\\\\\\'ll lose from this trip.  If I hear that  Serenade No. 13/Eine Klein Nachtmusik or whatever ONE MORE TIME I\\\\\\'m losing my shit. 3/15- The same cycle of calling, waiting a ridiculous amount of time on hold (3 hours), then no appointments. I\\\\\\'m getting very desperate and frustrated. In my time of desperation, I staked this reddit post and found the holy grail of reddit posts. I posted it here. I can help if people are confused because it took me a second. \\\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online\\\\\\\\_apps\\\\\\\\_look\\\\\\\\_at\\\\\\\\_the\\\\\\\\_network\\\\\\\\_traffic\\\\\\\\_to\\\\\\\\_get/(https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online_apps_look_at_the_network_traffic_to_get/)  I was able to see that my passport was labelled as \"Fulfillment\" which based on the reddit post  meant that it was ready to be printed and shipped. A glimmer of hope! I felt so much better. 3/16 - Senator\\\\\\'s office gets back to me and sends me a tracking number! Wahoo! Hopefully should get it by tomorrow or the next day. Online through the portal, it still reads a \"In Progress.\" Additionally, no updates directly from travel.gov(https://travel.gov) or the passport agency. EDIT -  3/17 - Travel Number by Senator was sent but no updates to USPS, just that label was printed. Called USPS customer service that said they didn’t have any info but that it should arrive by 3/17 at 6pm. I call passport agency and give them the update but they tell me they had already given USPS the passport.  3/18 - No passport. Called USPS again and opened a case, they said they wouldn’t be able to get back to me until Tuesday, 3/21. My flight is 3/19 at 6am. I drive to the post office with no help. I cancel my flights and move it to Tuesday in the hopes that it arrives on Monday.  3/20 - No passport. Called Passport & USPS again with no answers about the whereabouts of my passport except that it’s lost. On hold with passport customer service for the chance of an in person appointment but looking bleak. Most likely going to cancel the whole trip. :(  I am not one of the lucky ones! But hopefully you are.  Long story short-  \\\\\\\\-DO NOT APPLY ONLINE.  \\\\\\\\-If you did like me, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN/WOMEN!! They help!!  I felt very annoying bothering them, but I really do think it helped pushed my passport along and I actually got some information about the whereabouts of my passport!    \\\\n\\\\\\\\- If you feel compelled to call the NPIC, call in the evenings or exactly 7:58 AM!! Keep calling if they say they can\\\\\\'t take your call.  \\\\\\\\- 3/12 -My sister who is also traveling with me, LOST her passport, called the NPIC ONLY ONCE without any application or anything. No queue and got an appointment shortly the same day and received her passport within a few hours. Take this information as you will.  Thank you all for reading!\\', \\'Finally received my passport! Want to give my timeline and provide some hope to those anxiously waiting like I was:    - January 18th: applied for an expedited renewal online.     - January 29th: Email delivered confirming application was \"Received.\"    - February 2nd: After seeing no progress, decided to pay for expedited shipping as well to be safe.    - March 8th: The date of my trip is less than a month away (April 1st to Tokyo), locate this thread to see about advice. Send a request for passport help to one of my senators based on suggestions.    - March 9th: Senator\\\\\\'s office responds with a request for additional info (my birthdate), immediately follow up.    - March 11th: Find this thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online_apps_look_at_the_network_traffic_to_get/) with tips on how to check the network status. Find out my application is in \"Exception\" status. - March 13th: Check status again, see it has been moved to \"Adjudication.\"      - March 14th: Receive email that my application has been moved to \"In Process.\" Check network status; that has moved to \"Fulfillment.\" - March 16th: Receive an email from USPS informed delivery stating that I have a package from *PASSPORT SERVICES/DOS TUCSON* arriving today. My passport was delivered a short time later to my mailbox! Just received an email from the state department a few minutes ago ago stating my passport was \"shipped\" (lol).     All in all, took **8 weeks** to receive my renewed passport, when the initial promised window was 3-5 weeks. Thankfully it arrived before my travel date, but the constant technical difficulties and uncertainty leading up to today were a headache and a half.     \\\\n4 out of 10 would not recommend renewing online until the system is improved, so glad I won\\\\\\'t need to renew for at least another decade.\\', \\'Passport Timeline for online renewal: 12/19/22 - applied online for passport renewal for travel 4/1/23.

Waited 3 hours and never spoke to anyone. Hung up to try again Monday. 3/18/23 - Get notification from USPS (not Passport services) that there is an envelope being delivered today from Passport Services/ DOS Tucson. Passport delivered 3:00 pm &#x200B; Note: The status never changed from \"In Process\" and I was never notified that the passport shipped. I went to check the status today just to see what it says and all I got was an error message. I waited 13 weeks for this passport. But since it showed 2 weeks before my travel date, I have to believe that they are processing by that date and not order received. Very frustrating experience in all.\\', \\'My current timeline on a regular online renewal application: Submitted: Around 10pm on 12/30/22, received shortly after (deleted email) In process: 1/3/2023 ...That\\\\\\'s all.

I know I\\\\\\'m preaching to the choir here, lol. Just sharing where I\\\\\\'m at in case it helps anyone somehow. Edits: Contacted my congressman\\\\\\'s office on 3/21. They got back to me the next day and were told I was in routine processing and that I could upgrade to expedited. My f12 status changed to \"exception\" on 3/23. Followed up with my congressman\\\\\\'s office on 3/29. They called to tell me that NPIC told them they couldn\\\\\\'t provide my congressman an update because they had already given an update on my application to another congressman in another state. My congressman\\\\\\'s office told me that NPIC will only expedite applications that are within 5 days of travel, and then told me they\\\\\\'d contact me if they get any updates (in other words, they wanted me to stop emailing lol), but she did seem concerned that I was on week 13 when processing times were estimated to be 5-9 weeks when I submitted. My f12 status changed to \"fulfillment\" on 3/31. Status changed to \"printed\" on 4/3. No f12 status anymore. Got the email saying it was shipped on 4/4. Interestingly, it\\\\\\'s being shipped from Arizona, but NPIC told my congressman\\\\\\'s office that it was in process in Connecticut. Got my passport on 4/5.

The application was stuck on \"In Process\" all this time which devastated me as it was the last thing I needed. My locator number is Locator 55 which is in Dallas, Texas. I took the chance on the Google review rumors that the Dallas branch allows walk-ins and they did for me. I flew in yesterday morning and was able to get an in-person, same-day delivery passport in my hands from 8am-4pm. It was a long wait but it was worth it. If your locator number is 55 and you still need a passport, I highly recommend flying to Dallas and going to the agency, it might just save your trip.\\', \\'Got my 2 kids passports today!!!

Good luck everyone!\\', \\'I applied for my two kids on 5/6/2023. That is when I found out the processing times were 7 to 9 weeks. My trip was 6/28/2023. Asked for expedited processing. 5/12/2023 it was received at Location 77 and status was in progress. I checked every few days and no change. Then on 6/14/2023 I contacted my senator (NY) and requested his help. I messed up and only sent in one release form should have sent one per child so I had to redo and sent it back on 6/15/2023. Also on 6/15/2023 I called in the morning at 8:00 am eastern to their urgent travel phone line 1-877-487-2778 pressed 1 and then 2. Waited about 30 mins connected to a person who then transferred me to another department had to wait about 1.5 hours. Got another person on the line. He suggested I pay for the 1 day shipping and said he sent in a  request to speed up my review. I paid the $20 per application. Then the next day I checked the status and it said that both passports were approved that night the status changed to shipped. The next day 6/16/2023 I got both passports. Then the senator office replied that they sent inquires to the state dept. I told them I already received my passport.\\', \\'Welp, starting to sweat bricks here.

Make sure the photo meets the requirements. You can have your photo be taken at CVS, Walgreens, Meijer, etc. After I presented everything to the clerk, I paid for both adult book & adult card, expedited my passport, passport fee, and also paid for 1-2 day delivery fee for my birth certificate returned to me in the mail sooner.

TLDR: Expedited passport application + 1-2 day shipping, 34 days from application sent to approved/shipped (37 days total after delivery).

Called NPIC on 6/28 to mark my application as urgent Was notified by Congressman on 6/30 that my application was approved and passport shipped. Expected delivery on 7/3.  All in all, it took 34 days from sending my application to get it approved and will be 37 days total by the time I have my passport in my hands.  Advice I have for others in this position: Contact your Senators and Congressmen! I was hesitant about contacting both but it proved critical in my case, as one of them was more willing to send an inquiry about my application earlier than the other. NPIC seemed to pick up my call best when I called exactly at 8AM EST (or 5AM PST for me) or around the afternoon (11:45AM-12PM).

Got back from my trip a few days ago, driving into Canada the agent at the border crossing said nothing about my lack of a passport. Coming back into the states the agent asked me if I had a passport (“no”) and if I previously had a passport (“yes it’s in the process of being renewed”). That was it.    I called and spoke to someone at the Canadian Border Services Agency(https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/do-rb/offices-bureaux/200-eng.html) to verify this information before my trip.

I worked for the government at the USDA doing paperwork related to farmers. It\\\\\\'s a clusterfuck but now I feel like we were doing great compared to what must be going on with passport processing.  let me tell you when I worked for the USDA it was a shit show all the way from top to bottom. All of the software we had to use was 20 years out of date, think Microsoft silverlight and old internet explorer web tools and multiple isolated databases that had to be accessed in unnatural ways without descriptive UIs. We were also still using paper for many things in 2022 and manually filing things into massive filing cabinets and doing 1980s tasks like alphabetizing paper files by hand and marking them for actions with markers. Sometimes it was technically possible to do things via computer, but it was so convoluted it was actually *less work* to just do it by hand. It\\\\\\'s hard to convey to you how bad the systems were, it defies belief.  Government software I can only imagine is written by high school students who can\\\\\\'t speak to each other as they work, and this is due to the way the government gets it\\\\\\'s software contracts to the lowest bidder and the way the spec sheets are written. It\\\\\\'s just horrific. The convoluted systems also take months to truly learn, you couldnt put someone new into the hot seat and expect them to be useful for MINIMUM 3 MONTHS. You had a useless employee for 3 months who needs to be helped with every function because there is always an unintuitive \"trick\" not in the official training material.  There were databases that only a limited # of employees in the country could access at once at any given time. It was NEVER enough and constantly closed. This was for a specific map database that allowed me to draw in maps for some purposes. So i would come in to work early on the east coast and try to get in before 8 am to beat both the east coast and before other coast wakes up if I needed to use the specific mapping software for an application I\\\\\\'m working on. This shit caused endless delays and I\\\\\\'m trying to explain to farmers why their application for X isn\\\\\\'t ready and sound like a crazy person. We weren\\\\\\'t supposed to talk about these internal processes but I frequently did and told them to call congress about it being shit. (This is why I eventually wasn\\\\\\'t a phone person anymore lmao) So I have some idea the kind of hell all the people are in at the NPIC offices. Because of the above, most of them likely quit quickly and the people who stick around just don\\\\\\'t give a shit (that\\\\\\'s what happened where I was) and that\\\\\\'s how they stay sane. By not giving a shit about what they are doing and how fast it goes. Our office was also chronically understaffed for the amount of work we received, especially as it had a seasonal flow and we had 10x the work in the summer due to active farming. I of course quit and got a better job outside of the government after a year and a half of making honest effort because I couldn\\\\\\'t stay sane there.\\', \\'I applied in January, yet still haven’t received my passport.

I applied through the online passport renewal system on 1/4th. My passport was marked as “received” and never changed status. I’m traveling internationally on 2/21. After several calls to the passport status number, they told me my passport was indeed “in processing” on their end but couldn’t give me any more information. I called and called but no one was ever able to tell me the actual status of it. I later learned that the online passport renewal system is a beta program and lots of people are having issues. Today at my in person appointment (out of state) they made an announcement that it wasn’t made clear that the online renewal system was a beta program so lots of people applied and are having problems.   Today I got my passport in hand. I’ll let you know what I tried, and what did and didn’t work for me.  I tried a lot of tactics. I contacted my representatives, but other than emailing the passport agency for a status check, they didn’t do much, and weren’t that responsive to my emails. Other people had better luck with their reps so you should definitely try if you have travel coming up. When I was more than two weeks out from my trip, they told me I couldn’t make an appointment until it was within two weeks. Then, when I was 13 days away, they flipped again and said I couldn’t make an appointment because my passport was processing. THIS IS NOT TRUE. They kept pushing me days and days later to call again if it still didn’t arrive, eventually I got so frustrated I called multiple times in one day. Randomly, someone on the phone let me make an appointment. The only one available was on the day of my flight and I wouldn’t make it since it was out of state. But I still took it, thinking if I have to change my flight it won’t be great but at least I’ll get to go on the trip.  Then I got obsessed with playing the phone game. You can call as many times as you want and keep checking for cancelled appointments. On Monday, I woke up at 8am and kept calling until I was able to get an appointment for one this Wednesday. I would call, wait on hold for an hour and a half, fail, try again. Once I went so far as to almost have one in my state but when the representative hit save someone else got it. I kept calling and repeating all day long until I got it. It was maddening, and the hold music was stuck in my head all night. But it worked. I got an appointment someone had cancelled in DC.  I traveled out of state and booked a hotel, then I went to the passport agency this morning in DC. They were really wonderful and kind. The process was: they took my application and info, and then they took a little while to check my online application information (prob 30 mins), then they called me back and told me I could come pick up the new passport at 11:30am. I can’t even describe the relief. They cancelled my online application and just did the renewal there. Here’s what I had to bring: The form DS-82, a physical passport photo (I brought a backup too), proof of travel (I printed a flight confirmation), and my expired passport book. That’s all they needed for my case but make sure to ask what you need specifically as there could be different cases. You might also want to bring a checkbook if you didn’t pay for expedited from the beginning.  These Reddit threads helped me a lot so I wanted to help out some other people. If you applied in the online renewal system and have travel within two weeks, don’t wait… it’s better to have an appointment while waiting for it to arrive because you can always release the appointment if it does. When it gets down to the wire it’s really stressful. And they’re having a lot of issues with these online application. Keep believing and working hard at it, you can do it! 💖🎀✨\\', \\'Finally got my passport today, so thought I\\\\\\'d share another data point.

As for using your current passport for your upcoming trip, don’t think you can.  Do you still have the email you received when they notified you your application was changed to “processing”? If not, at the end of that email it tells you when your application reached the “processing” stage your current passport is immediately invalidated.  I’ve been reading this megathread since mid January (applied Online 11/20/22 with expedited and express shipping, original travel date 2/2, status changed to processing 01/14 and remains until this day, missed my travel date, rescheduled for 03/15).  Your best bet is to reach out to your senate or congressional rep ASAP, they can get more information on your status and help push the application process or an in-person appointment within 5 days of travel date (appointments are hard to come by though, based on what I’ve read on here).

This is my plan, AFTER I get my passport so I don\\'t jeopardize my application progress....last thing I need is for some department to pull my application for review or whatever.  I believe they should issue me a refund on the expedited fee I paid back in November when I still don\\'t have my passport nearly 4 months later.\", \\'Working again now\\', \\'I am happy for you.  I hope I get to be this happy too.  :)\\', \\'What documents did you need to bring to your in person appointment? I’ve already mailed in my old passport…\\', \\'The online system is a mess. That message means nothing I have been seeing it for 7 weeks. What did help was doing what was suggested in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online\\\\\\\\_apps\\\\\\\\_look\\\\\\\\_at\\\\\\\\_the\\\\\\\\_network\\\\\\\\_traffic\\\\\\\\_to\\\\\\\\_get/(https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/11nwl89/online_apps_look_at_the_network_traffic_to_get/) Using this method I discovered my passport was in \"closeout\" meaning done and shipped. Next, I went to the regular passport tracking site for those who applied by mail. It turns out that many online applications were moved to paper (typically those of us who contacted government reps for help it seems). I entered my info just to see and it came up that my passport has been mailed and there is a tracking number. On the online site, my application status just says \"in process.\" This week, I called multiple times to get an in person appointment, Some days I just got a buys signal. Once, after being on hold for 3 hours, I was told there were no appointments anywhere in the United States.  Good luck and hope this info helps you!\\', \\'Reach out to your state rep again and see if they can find out where your passport is being processed.  We reached out to ours (in WI) and someone responded very quickly and told us our kids’ passports were being processed in Charleston.  Did some digging and found numbers there and just kept trying different lines until I got someone on the phone.  Our travel date is also 3/23 and it’s been 10 weeks now (supposed to be 6-9).  The woman who helped me got our passports processed the next day and said she’d send them out priority mail.  The website finally updated and says we should have them by the 19th, and I believe it will be sooner.\\', \\'Contact your congressperson or state reps when you are 14 days away from your travel date - they can help move it forward.\\', \\'If you google your congress person or your state senator there will be a section of their website that says “help with a federal agency”. You can email them with your appropriate documents usually including a privacy waiver with an original signature. They usually get back to you within 24 hours. I would contact your congress person and both senators to see who can provide the best help. Don’t have more than one gov org put in an inquiry though because that can cause duplicate inquiries at the passport agency. See who provides the best timeline or responds first and go with them.\\', \\'Someone over on r/passport just went to San Juan said they were done talking to someone at 10am and came back at 2pm to pick up the passport.\\', \\'Senator Feinstein’s office has been of no help to me. They started off pretty responsive, but it stops there. They will put in an inquiry for you and that’s it. I’m supposed to leave Friday and she wouldn’t even try to help me get an urgent in person appointment. Basically told me to plan better next time. When I spoke with my Rep’s office, they were much nicer at least.\\', \\'My travel date is a day before yours. I have been told that they wont even start looking at stuff traveling after 3/31 until late day/tomorrow. Contact our rep and have them send an inquiry and help you.\\', \\'removed\\', \\'Oops, might have been my fault.\\', \\'keep us updated! All the best!\\', \\'I paid for expedited shipping and it was approved, printed and shipping label created on a Monday evening, and it was delivered Wednesday morning.\\', \\'Yeah that’s insane. Mine was received the same day as yours and I’m traveling 5/11. Same locator number. Have someone at my senator’s office working on getting me an appointment as there’s a passport office in my city, but I’m still starting to freak out a little.\\', \"hmm.. here\\'s hoping mine goes through this week then. Sent 4/6, received 4/10.  Also locator 69\", \\'Update: passports arrived this morning! 2.5 days before flight!\\', \\'Hey Molasses any news back from your status with passport.  Mine has been in Process for 4weeks expedited service. And this morning I checked and it changed to Not Available. Thanks hope you got yours already.\\', \\'They typically go \"in process\" within a few days of mailing, so it seems like either you\\\\\\'re entering the information in a way that is different than what is in the system, or the mail was lost. I would call them first thing in the morning, and I mean to the second, as described elsewhere in this thread.\\', \\'Mine went \"in process\" on 5/19 as well for expedited. Still says in process today 6/30 and we leave for international travel on 7/8 😅 \\\\nCurrently on hold to speak to NPIC to see if I can get an appointment somewhere. Best case scenario would be seeing that wonderful \"approved\" online at some point today.\\', \\'The big guns is you contact your representative. They likely have someone on their staff dedicated to this problem. The phone option is to get to the end of the options exactly at 8:00:00 AM Eastern time.\\', \"So I guess they\\'re just suddenly competent? You\\'re the second data point suggesting that somehow the system has been unjammed. Congrats on that new passport smell.\", \\'could you tell us what passport center yours went to?  I sent mine in 7/10, still says in process DOT 8/25\\', \\'Yes. Expedite - you might be able to it online.\\', \"You can contact your local congress or senator office for help. You are lucky you applied over mail (versus online renewal). Over mail applicants seem to get their passports quicker or can get better assistance. Once you are within 14 days of travel and still don\\'t receive your passport, you can try to get an in person emergency appointment at passport agency. Hopefully you live close to a passport agency or doesn\\'t come to that point.\", \\'Similar situation. I applied 1/6 and leave 3/10 and i have no fucking idea what to do right now\\', \\'Send your to all three of them (assuming you’re not in DC).  My rep’s office actually came through with an in-person appt for me. Things really get serious when you’re 5 days out. I know how stressful it is - I was having dreams about this, couldn’t sleep, was eating all kinds of crap… it was the worst.\\', \\'I reached out to Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Grace Meng. I live in Queens by the way\\', \"I shouldn\\'t be shocked at how archaic and incompetent our government is, yet here we are.\", \"Do they confirm with you before they actually make an inquiry? Don\\'t want to reach out to multiple people from congress and senators if they\\'ll all submit the inquiry.\", \\'Ugh, that\\\\\\'s awful!! And \"plan better\"?! So insulting. I\\\\\\'m assuming that like most of us, you planned around the processing times that were listed. Not so much an issue of planning better, more an issue of reform and check/balances needed for the state department.\\', \\'From what I’ve seen it depends on the locator. Philly seems to be good and Dallas seems to be awful\\''}"
